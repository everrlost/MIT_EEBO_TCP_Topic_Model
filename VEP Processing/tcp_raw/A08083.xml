            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I haue heretofore heard the Abbot of <hi>Boys Oliuier</hi> report (being a per≈øon ≈øufficiently knowne for the good offices which he daily performeth, both to the Church of Rome, and his King) that this pre≈øent Pope <hi>Paulus Quintus,</hi> is very affectionately addicted to France, and that this <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> is a man very deuout, and of a mo≈øt innocent life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øation.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> booke for a time will be but a ≈ømall pepin (or kernell) but with growth of yeares he will grow to be a very thicke Forre≈øt, full of trees and branches; and if it be not in time lopped and prun'd, it will finally ouertop and beate downe the fruit of the French trees life, and infect it as the Salamander which lurketh in the hollow of ≈øome fruit tree; and ≈øo through his extreme coldene≈ø≈øe, doth by little and little cau≈øe him to wither and die.</p>

                  <p>But notwith≈øtanding this, I ≈øee not that eyther the king or Queene gouerne or rule the Ie≈øuites, and that for all the multitude of Benefices &amp; fauors be≈øtowed vpon them, they cannot yet draw them to loue them, much le≈ø≈øe to liue as good ≈øubiects, &amp; containe them≈øelues in peace, without innouating ≈øome things among≈øt vs: but rather I ≈øee they alone thinke to draw all France to them, and beleeue them≈øelues able at one blow, yea and with high wre≈øtling now in the kings minority, to obtaine that, whereof during the life of great <hi>Henry,</hi> they dur≈øt not pre≈øume to haue dream't.

                  <p>Already through their confidents they inioy the principall offices both of the Parliament and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike authority, e≈øteeming by meanes hereof, during the Kings minority, ≈øo to ≈øecure and inuellop them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in the ≈øtate, that through their intelligences it will be lawfull for them to diuert and turne it as they plea≈øe.

In re≈øpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you then ought and are bound to maintaine and defend it. I ≈øay further that the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes of Guerchuille, and Maignelet, Ladies of greater re≈øpect, and farre higher renowne then the former, would before the others, haue incited the very dogs again≈øt the Ie≈øuites, as ≈øoone as they

And for the Duke of E≈øpernon, he hath ≈øo farre experience in the de≈øtruction of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, his mo≈øt deare and debonaire ma≈øter, what mi≈øery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation this opinion and vniu≈øt po≈øition hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioned, that maketh Popes the Soueraignes of the kings of France; that I dur≈øt beleeue he wel acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that to be a true French man, he lo≈øeth not the e≈ø≈øence of a good Catholique. I come now to <hi>Mon≈øieur Pre≈øident Siguier,</hi> which notwith≈øtanding he hath beene the kings Aduocat and Lieutenant ciuill of Paris: and therefore well knoweth with what ballances Magi≈øtrates ought to weigh ≈øuch drugges: yet I mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly know, that of late he hath vowed to a man of good re≈øpect and fame, that it were profitable, if the Ie≈øuites bee permitted to liue in France, they ≈øhould ≈øweare to ob≈øerue the French Maximes, or el≈øe that they ≈øhould be exiled and bani≈øhed France. But there is another ≈øcruple, to wit, that the Prote≈øtants will reioyce to ≈øee the Ie≈øuites pur≈øued: which neuertheles doth not a≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh me, that we feare to annoy them which by their bookes and actions ≈øeeke to depriue vs of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and haue no compa≈ø≈øion of vs, while≈øt the con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations

Let vs therefore giue the Prote≈øtants leaue to laugh, and in the meane time let vs defend our ≈øelues from the Ie≈øuites: for the one importeth vs more then the other.
