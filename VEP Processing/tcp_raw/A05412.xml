            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing ſome fiue or ſixe yeres ſince in thoſe partes of Flanders, which are ſubiect to the Spaniſh king, and ſeeing a miſerable troupe of my vnhappie countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (ſome of which were gentlemen of good hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in England,) wandring in poore habites &amp; afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted geſtures, heauily groning vnder the burthen of an extreeme and calamitous neceſſitie: on the one ſide, by their heedleſſe demeanure there, debarred from returne into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: and on the other, daily ouerlooked with the proud eyes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull Spaniards, and for want of due regarde in that comfortleſſe ſeruice, periſhing without either pity or reliefe. Seeing, as I ſay, theſe things and entring into a conſideration of them, with an vnpartiall iudgement, knowing ſome of my good friendes and acquaintance in England, poſſeſſed with the like humor, as that which mooued the foreſaid gentlemen, to forſake their countrie and to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the ſeruice and dominions of the king of Spaine: I thought good to aduertiſe them of that which my poore experience had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered touching the ſmall regard, diſtreſſe, pouertie, ſcorne, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, &amp; affliction, befallen to ſuch as had alreadie entred the courſe, that to their vnexperienced iudgement, yealded ſuch ſhew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: therby, if it were poſſible, to diſſuade them from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like, the ſame being in regard of the offence to their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſo trecherous; of the reproche to their familye, and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; ſo infamous, and laſtly in ſo deepe a degree to themſelues dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that being once thereinto entered, it ſhould not bee in their power, vpon their afterchange of humor and appetite, thence to withdraw themſelues, the error being ſuch as admitteth not any repentaunce or excuſe. Hauing to that effect, written from thence priuatly to ſome of my acquaintaunce, the coppies of my letters (contrarie to my intention) were ſince my returne, by ſome of them giuen abrode, and laſtly not long ſince, a diſcourſe printed in Paules Church-yarde, conteining ſome parte of the ſubſtance
<pb facs="tcp:8993:3"/>thereof, but manye thinges that I had written left out, and manye thinges inſerted that I neuer ment, and finally in the whole ſo falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and chaunged, aſwell in matter as words, &amp; ignorantly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with fictions of the publiſher, that howſoeuer the vulgar ſorte bee therewith pleaſed, thoſe that are of farther reach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, cannot but condemne it as a thing fabulous, groſſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and full of abſurdities. Beſides, the time and occaſion to which that diſcourſe was fitting, is now altogether paſt, and therefore the ſame altogether impertinent. In regard of which and other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, I thought it not vnfitte to publiſh the true coppy of my owne letter, which though after ſo many yeares, cannot but ſeeme ſtale, yet the occaſions that moued me thereunto conſidered, I truſt I ſhall not otherwiſe be cenſured of, then the ſinceritie of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſerueth, which is to dedicate the fruicts of my poore experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the benefit of my countrie, and withall to ſatisfie the world, as touching the former treatiſe (for though they are ſuppreſſed, yet there are greate numbers of them extant) the which was by a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that had ſtolne a coppy thereof, foyſted to the print, in hope of benefit, and now when the matter comes to examination, ſlipps his head out of the Coller and will not bee found. Withall, I ſhall perchaunce, ſeeing I haue ſo good an occaſion offered, touch by the way ſome occurrents of later time. And whereas my meaning was at the firſt, onely to ſatisfie a few priuate friendes, now ſeeing it is my chaunce to publiſh it, I ſhall entreate the Reader whoſoeuer he be, &amp; howſoeuer in religion affected, neuertheleſſe laying aſide all preiudicate opinion, not to condemne any thing (ſeeme the ſame neuer ſo ſtrange) heerein mencioned, vnleſſe hee ſhall himſelfe be able to diſprooue it, which I hope, for trewneſſe of matter it ſhal not lie in any mans power to do. For my meaning is not to ſpeak of ſophiſticall deuices, proiected driftes, or matters forged in the ayre, but plainly and ſimply, of thinges actually and really doone in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique view of the world, and confirmed with the witneſſe of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes.</p>

I heartely and moſt earneſtly deſire you &amp; all other that ſhall reade this Treatiſe, deeply to iudge and conſider of theſe pointes, which I ſhall heerein ſet downe, which (God willing) I will doo with ſuch fidelitie, true meaning, and ſinceritie, as that no parte of the ſame ſhall be truly to be gainſaid or refelled, and my ſelfe by the perſons, times, and places, and other circumſtances, ſhall make moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and plaine, to anie that ſhall doubt of the truth of the ſame, or anie part thereof. And I ſhal take great ioy and comfort, if my ſelf hauing vndertaken an vntowardly &amp; dangerous courſe, though with better ſucceſſe than hath happened to many hundreds, may be as a caueat to all the young Gentlemen of our nation, how they hazard themſelues ſo daungerouſly: and that my painfull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb facs="tcp:8993:4"/>may be to them as a Looking glaſſe, wherein they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſpots &amp; errors of their conceiued fanſies, or as a marke ſet vp for them, whereby they may auoid the perills and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rockes and ſhelfes, to them yet vnknowen, and lying hidden vnder the ſmooth, faire, and delightfull conceiued, and fantaſied pleaſures ſuggeſted vnto them by their owne imagination, the ſame being vnexperienced, and therefore without miſtrust. And ſurely I cannot too much commend the ſaying of that excellent Romane Orator, who placed in the firſt degree of wiſedome, thoſe that were of themſelues beſt able to giue good aduiſe, and in the next, thoſe that were willing, and inclinable to follow it.</p>
                  <p>But ſome man may here perchance aske me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I haue ſuch an aſſurance of my wit, that I will take vpon me to aduiſe others, who are perchance better able to counſell me?

Whoſe courſe &amp; actions (thogh the lawe of God, the law of nations, the duetie to our Soueraigne, and the loue to our countrie, bindeth vs
<pb facs="tcp:8993:6"/>to deteſt and hate, becauſe they followe an oppoſite armed enemie that ſeeketh our ſubuerſion: yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are of the ſame nation and language which we are of, charitie &amp; kindnes wiſheth vs to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of their abuſed conceits, and to wiſh them yet now at length to open their eies, and to beholde the dangerous eſtate wherein they haue plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the infamie and ſcorne wherein they liue, yea, vnder thoſe whom they ſerue as hirelings: and laſtly, the reprochful blot that they haue giuen to the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our heretofore vnblemiſhed nation, which in former ages, howſoeuer laboring in inteſtine broiles, yet neuer was detected of ſuch baſe &amp; wicked treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as to ſell themſelues to a forreine prince, to be by him imploied to the ouerthrow of their countrie, and the taking awaie of their Soueraignes life.</p>
                  <p>This is the vnpleaſing ſubiect I muſt intreat of, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing forcibly vnto it the recitall of ſo many conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, murthers, violences, practiſes, and treaſons, that for the ſtrangeneſſe thereof, it will rather beare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a tragical fiction, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a true diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The method of this inſuing Diſcourſe.</note>I will firſt direct my ſpeeches to ſuch vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced gentlemen, as are in deſire addicted to the Spaniſh ſeruice, ſhewing them in what point of their hope &amp; expectation they doo faile and are deceiued, laying vnto them before their eies, the fall, miſerie, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of as many as haue before them entered within the compas of this inchanted circle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to our credulous Catholikes at home, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe ignorance &amp; driftles ſearch into theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, our practiſing traitors abroad do bulid their che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt foundations of al their vilanies (whom while they
<pb facs="tcp:8993:6"/>entertain with vaine expectations, in the meane time, with traitors &amp; ſpies which they daily ſend ouer) they abuſe with ouer-reaching ſubtilties, to the irreparable ruine and ouerthrow of them and theirs.</p>
                  <p>They haue alſo at their deuotion certaine ambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexter felowes, who vpon fained colours and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſſe to &amp; fro, feeding either ſide with newes, who in regard of ſome few bad inteligences, which now &amp; then they bring into <hi>England,</hi> would faine be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honeſt ſeruiceable men: but they muſt pardon me a litle, in reſpect of ſome experience that I haue had of them, if I conceiue otherwiſe, thinking them to be in deed farre more dangerous than either the ſecret ſpie, or the diſcouered traitor, and in place where when I ſhall be askt, I will yeelde my reaſon. For ſince I was a ſcholler, I remember a verſe in Seneca,<note place="margin">Seneca in Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua Tragedia Agamemnon.</note> 
                     <hi>Pretio parata vincitur pretio ſides:</hi> I ſpeake this, becauſe the Prince whome they ſerue, howſoeuer otherwiſe, with theſe fellowes will not ſticke to deale moſt liberally.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe many of our countrymen liuing in great happines at home, yet (like thoſe that cannot take good reſt when they lie ſoft) doo in their conceit miſlike (ſurfetting with to much eaſe) the quiet eſtate they liue in, and the maner of her Maieſties moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; mercifull gouernment, I haue thought it my dutie ſomewhat to expreſſe theſe fewe thinges which haue come to my knowledge touching the benefites and bleſsings which it hath pleaſed God ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to poure downe upon her maieſty and her people: together with the flouriſhing eſtate of that fortunate realme, ſince this the time of her Maieſties gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo plentifull in peace, ſo victorious in warres, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:8993:7"/>induſtrious in artes, &amp; ſo excelling in all ſciences, that the verie Spaniſh enemie himſelfe will not ſtick many times to breake out into admiration thereat,<note place="margin">The Spaniſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie himſelfe admireth the bleſſed eſtate and happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of England.</note> and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his ſcoffing or rather blaſphemous humour ſweare that he thinkes Ieſu Chriſt is become a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: withall, I will briefly make a ſhort compariſon betweene this and the gouernment of the aduerſarie, I meane the king of Spaine, his cruell and inhumane vſage of his miſerable ſubiects, his violent abolition &amp; taking awaie of their priuiledges, and in fine, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bondage, conſtrained ſeruitude, and pittiful deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in which they liue, or rather deſpairfully do languiſh: a matter though farre vnfit for mee to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but worthie of grauer wits, &amp; men of the higheſt wiſdome and experience, yet conſidering I ſhall not preſume to treate of matters of great eſtate &amp; ſecrets, but ſuch as euerie well affected ſubiect may finde and picke out of the heroicall actions of the one, and the tyrannicall inſolencies of the other, both done in the apparance of the world, I hope, and ſo with all lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes moſt humbly deſire her moſt gracious &amp; benigne maieſtie to pardon mee, if vndertaking ſuch a taske, I chance to come far ſhort of that, which men fitter for the handling thereof could ſaie or intreat, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt earneſtly beſeech that I may therin be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured according to the loyall zeale I beare to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſeruice and my countrie, and not to the baſenes and ſimplicitie of my ſtile, or the handling thereof.</p>
                  <p>But to come to my diſcourſe, to the end that you &amp; the reſt of your opinion, may cleerely and plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne thoſe things, which hetherto your eies blinded with the vaile of partialitie, or perchance miſled with
<pb facs="tcp:8993:7"/>a contrarietie of affection, haue not bin able to view: I will begin with the good vſage, honor, and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you and other Gentlemen addicted to the Spaniſh ſeruice are to expect, bringing you for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſundrie braue and worthie Gentlemen, Captains, &amp; ſouldiers, that haue taken the like cauſe before you; whereby you ſhall perceiue that all is not golde that gliſtereth faire, but that whatſoeuer ſhew the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard make vnto vs, yet in his heart hee mortally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, &amp; by all meanes poſsible ſeeketh our deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ruine, and ſubuerſion, as it euidently appeareth by his vſage of ſuch troups and companies of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as haue ſerued him.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpeak of the crueltie of the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor vpon certaine Engliſh Gentlemen that had done notable ſeruices both to him and the Duke of Alua,<note place="margin">Eight Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hanged vp in Antwarp by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Don Luis Reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:8993:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>my time of being there, and in matters deliuered by hereſaie I might erre, which (vndertaking to write no thing but that which is true &amp; vnrefutable) I wold be loth to doo, and therefore I will come to things of later time, and ſuch as I doo certainly know.</p>
                  <p>At the ſiege of <hi>Audenarde,</hi> where the D. of <hi>Parma</hi> laie incamped, there came rendering themſelues vnto his ſeruice, vnder the conduct of <hi>Norris, Barney, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and <hi>Gibſon,</hi>

                  <p>This Gentleman, to the end you ſhould the better know him, was one of the craftieſt Conicatchers that euer liued, and had all his life time ſhifted it out with cooſening ſleightes and practiſes of vilanie, as all the olde Flaunders ſouldiers that knewe hym, can well teſtifie: now by reaſon of his good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee was growne verye weather wiſe, and did by manye coniectures foreſee the ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes that were comming towardes him and hys followers, and therefore thinking it a great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to lye ſtill at Anker in ſo daungerous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a roade, hoyſed vpp his ſayles and ſhewed them a fayre payre of heeles, running awaye from them at Torney, where the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> then kepte his Courte, into Fraunce, yet becauſe hee woulde not bee in hys abſence vnremembred, hee firſt tooke vp vppon his credite as much wares, as by all his vtmoſt deuiſes hee coulde procure, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercers, Goldſmithes, or anye other ſorte of Artificers.

The cauſe that had drawen him into this matter, as ſundry times he told me, and ſometimes not without teares, were the many debts, with which (being very youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully giuen) he had intangled himſelfe in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; withal his marriage, which was moſt vnfortunate.

He followed a while the warres of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelf ſo well, that he was aduanced to honeſt degrees in her Maieſties ſeruice, ſuch as among ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are accounted honourable and of reputation, at length beeing brought thence, not without great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of ill carrying himſelfe in matter of allegeance to her Maieſtie, yet he found ſuch aſſured friends, that he did not onely recouer his libertie and freedome, but alſo taſted verie deeply of their liberalities, ſuch, as I thinke ſome of them, though verie honourable, ſcarcely euer vſed the like to anie, and ingaged wyth theſe curteſies, which for euer wold haue tied a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde, he was ſuffered to depart the realme. All which notwithſtanding, it is reported, that there is not anie beyond the ſea, that doth run a more violent and vnreuerent courſe againſt the perſon of her Maieſtie,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:23"/>and the ſtate of our Countrie than he doth, at which truly I do much wonder, how a minde not altogether void of reaſon and humanitie, can ſuffer it ſelf to ſinke into ſo deepe a degree of ingratitude. Let him yet at length looke into his owne conſcience, and if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits receiued claime not his fidelity &amp; ſeruice, yet at leaſt let them keepe him from attempting villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I ſpeake this in reſpect of his owne good, and not that hee nor ten thouſand more ſuch as he is, is able to doo her Maieſtie or her realme a halfepenie worth of harme, for the mightie hande of God, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued valour of her faithfull ſubiectes are able, and wyll alwayes defend and protect her againſt whatſoeuer violence of whoſoeuer her malitious enemies, who hetherto haue done her no farther harme, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to periſh, and to bee confounded in their owne deuiſes, and I hope it ſhall neuer be otherwiſe.

                  <p>As for the other Captains &amp; Gentlemen that haue anie true Engliſh bloud in them, let them yet (for they are thoſe to whom I chiefly intend my ſpeeches) look with a diſcreeter iudgement into the depth of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, let them not tire out their yeres and youth in ſo comfortles and vnrewarded a ſeruice, the end wherof is neuer other than vntimely death, deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, let them not truſt themſelues to ſleep in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of a flattering ſtepmother, that holdeth a knife in her hand to cut their throates, when they may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:8993:24"/>throw themſelues into the armes of a louing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mother, that will receiue them, comming like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and obedient children, with true teares &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy. Let them caſt backe theyr eyes vpon the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and greatneſſe of her Maieſtie, theyr ſoueraigne Princeſſe, who in deed is a true and louing mother to vs all, let them but looke into the happie and bleſſed eſtate of their natiue Countrie, and finally conſider the dutie they doo owe vnto them both. They are not yet ſo farre paſt, but that their ſubmiſsion may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: yea, and ſuch ſeruices they may do, highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded too.</p>
                  <p>But leauing theſe digreſsions, to which I know not what zeale tranſporteth me, iudge now (I praie you) what reward, honor, &amp; aduancement you may expect of the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that neuer deſerued of him anie fauour or good vſage, when you ſee theſe men ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to periſh, and that in ſo miſerable eſtate, that haue done him ſo many, ſo great, and ſo waightie ſeruices. But perchance you will ſaie that hee hath dealt better with priuate men tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath done with thoſe tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous militar troups: if you can name me but anie one that he hath raiſd or aduanced to honor, or that liueth richly or wealthily in his ſeruice, I will name you an hundred that being Gentlemen of good houſes &amp; of worthie merit, haue conſumed, languiſhed, and bene brought to nothing in his ſeruice, yea, &amp; ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> periſhed &amp; died for lack of ſuſtenance.

<pb facs="tcp:8993:24"/>with a man onely or two to ſerue him: where on the other ſide, I will recken you vp of thoſe that are onely for want of things neceſſarie, &amp; of pure pouertie,<note place="margin">Sundry Engliſh Gentlemen of good houſes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue periſhed in the King of Spaines ſeruice.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and dead, M. <hi>Dakers, Michael Tempeſt,</hi> old <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Iſrael Harman, Markenfield, Tremaine, Stradling, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Carew, Edward Allen, Fleming, Suthwell, Bulmer,</hi> with ſundry others of good race &amp; credit in their countrie.</p>
                  <p>But to recite vnto you the names of thoſe that doo yet liue ſo poorely &amp; vncomfortably in his penſion, would be a matter too tedious, &amp; therefore take them all in generall, <hi>C.

                  <p>Such a <hi>Liberança</hi> (I ſaie) as this was graunted to the Engliſh penſioners in the yeere aboueſayde, for three moneths paie, of which till October in the yere 1590.

So that they were faine to returne poore and pennyleſſe, and did in that inſtant of which I ſpeake, liue in ſo poore and pittifull, a ſort, that truly it was a griefe to ſee it: inſomuch that I knew a Gentleman that ſolde his part there, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 24. pounds, for three poundes. But perchance you will ſaie hee giueth great penſions, &amp; intertaineth many of our nation.

The one, (and I name them firſt, for otherwiſe they would not take it well) pretend to be great ſtate-men and deepe polititians,<note place="margin">Men of ſtate &amp; pollicie.</note> theſe will not vouchſafe to looke on anie other booke but ſuch as treate of high matter, pollicy, and gouernment, as <hi>Bodins</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>Machiuels</hi> Prince, <hi>Lipſius</hi> his Politikes, <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Lawes, and ſuch like. Neither is there anie of theſe, no not the leaſt, but thinks himſelfe ſufficient to be a Magnifico of Venice. There is a ſecond ſort, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuoted to the folowing and faction of the Ieſuits,<note place="margin">Ieſuitiſted</note> ſeruing them as their eſpials and inſtruments in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they imploy them: theſe are verie hatefull to the reſt, and are dangerous to conuerſe withall, not ſo much in regard that anie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are able to do a chips worth of harme, as of their willingneſſe to do it if they were able.

The fartheſt drifte of their religion is, to ſpeake ill of the Queene, to ſay the Pope is a good man, and to thumpe their breaſts hard when they come to Church: I knew one of them that hauing ſometimes beene a pettie merchant in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſolde all that euer hee had, and putting two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poundes in his purſe, went to Hieruſalem to buy a pound of waxe candles, which hee brought home vpon his back, and withal as much earth of the mount Oliuet as hee was able to carrie: imagining that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dram thereof was able to caſt out a legion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. In regard of which reliques, vppon his returne to Bruſſels, hee obtained a penſion, where hee ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth: and truely hee may bee a good man, for I thinke hee liueth in as great pouertie as euer did anie of the Apoſtles, though perchance not ſo voluntarie, but the beſt is, he will not giue his beſt friend the leaſt mite of his holye thinges, ſaying that hee reſerueth them to furniſh the Churches in England, when they ſhall come one daie to bee Catholique, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie appoynted what Churches they bee that hee meanes to make beholding vnto him for this high benefite.</p>
                  <p>I would haue named the particular names of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one according to the factions to which they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but that I feare this laſt remembred ſort would haue beene angrie with me, and withall, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſpect or two beſides: but aboue all theſe, there is one ouer-ruling faction, that hath drawen
<pb facs="tcp:8993:33"/>them into mightie partialities and ſtrange extremities one againſt another. The originall whereof ſprong out of the Romiſh Seminary betweene the Engliſh &amp; the Welch: either partie had for fauourer and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor a man of great authoritie, to which leaned Doctor <hi>Allen</hi> for the one, and Doctour <hi>Lewes</hi> for the other, a man verie wiſe and learned,<note place="margin">Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween D: Lews and D: Allen</note> and by reaſon of his age, grauitie, and long continuance in thoſe parts, of great authoritie in the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſince in the later end of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> created Biſhop of <hi>Caſano</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> but alwayes a verie bitter enemie to the Ieſuites. In fine, each nation with all vehemencie laboured for the preſidentſhip and ſuperioritie one ouer the other. The Welchmen pretended the firſt foundation of the Colledge to haue bin by a Britiſh king, for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall behoofe of his Countrymen. The Engliſhmen likewiſe alleadging their reaſons: but in the end doo what they could, they were by the Welchmen cauſed to auoid the houſe. Wherupon (with their fardles vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their neckes, as being readie to depart the towne) they preſented themſelues vnto Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> whom with a lamentable Oration they moued to take ſuch compaſsion of them, that he cauſed them to returne, taking (to theirfull contentment) order between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and their aduerſaries. Notwithſtanding which recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, there ſtill remained a great hart-burning &amp; diſlike.

But in the end tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the inſtant purſuite of the Ieſuites, who ſpared
<pb facs="tcp:8993:33"/>no trauel nor expence, they procured vnto D.<hi>Allen</hi> ſuch mightie friends, that the lot and preheminence of this dignitie fell vpon him, of whom, &amp; of the Ieſuites, and of their faction, were for euer mortally hated, all thoſe that had bin anie waie fauorers or well-willers to D.<hi>Lewes:</hi> but chiefly &amp; among the reſt one <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all which, ſo effectuall and forcible were the means with which they practiſed againſt him, that they got him to bee impriſoned in <hi>Paris,</hi> laying to his charge that hee was an intelligencer for ſir <hi>Frances Walſingham,</hi> a traitor to the ſeruice of the Queen his miſtres, and from time to time a diſcouerer of her practiſes, and withall procured the ſayd queene to conceiue exceedingly ill of him, and taking the receiuers ſhip of her dowrie in <hi>France</hi> from him, to beſtow the ſame vpon the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe.</hi> Yet for all this <hi>Morgan</hi> found ſuch friends in the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that by the Popes expreſſe commandementes directed from time to time to his <hi>Nuntio</hi> then reſident at <hi>Paris,</hi> he was ſet at libertie, and therupon began to make his iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to the world, and withall bitterly to inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his aduerſaries, &amp; the wrongs which they had don him. Likewiſe at that inſtant there was a booke printed
<pb facs="tcp:8993:34"/>in <hi>Paris,</hi> publikely accuſing the Ieſuites of many wicked practiſes and moſt malitious impieties, of which they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected <hi>Morgan,</hi> and ſure I thinke it was his worke, but they could neuer apparantly proue it againſt him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that they had in this failed, they determined to take their reuenge by another courſe: to effect the which, they vſed as an inſtrument a young Gentleman called <hi>Gage,</hi> whom by many pratiſes they ſuborned &amp; incenſed thereunto: the manner whereof was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Morgan</hi> being come downe into the low countries in company of the L.<hi>Paget,</hi> &amp; his brother <hi>Charls,</hi> hauing bin one night late at euening ſeruice in the Church of Saint <hi>Gudala</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> was as he came down the church ſtaires encountered in the darke by <hi>Gage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Morgan woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Gage, ſuborned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</note> &amp; by him grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded in the face. Who thereupon preſently fled, thinking that he had ſlaine him, but afterwardes by the means and earneſt purſuit of the L.<hi>Paget,</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. The Ieſuites and their partie ſeemed at the firſt ſtifly to deny that they had bin the cauſers of this fact, but the ſequel of their proceedings made it moſt apparant to the whole world. For when <hi>Morgan,</hi> the L.<hi>Paget,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of his friends labored verie earneſtly &amp; with petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto the duke, to haue the rigor &amp; ſeueritie of iuſtice to proceed againſt him by whom this great violence was offred, they firſt labored for reconciliation, which being flatly refuſed,<note place="margin">Morgan accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites of treaſon.</note> then to ſtop the plaintifes mouthes, and to preuent ſuch miſchiefes as they feared might inſue, they found no better meanes than once again to accuſe <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> of treaſon, laying to his charge ſundrie points of tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, as well in former matters concerning the Scottiſh queen, as alſo the ſeruice &amp; perſon of the d.of <hi>Parma.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they accuſed him to haue bin a ſetter on of <hi>Gilford</hi> &amp; his confederates, in ſuch practiſes as they had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:8993:34"/>by ſir <hi>Frances Walſinghams</hi> warrant &amp; ſetting on, &amp; to that end they ſent <hi>Chriton</hi> the Scottiſh Ieſuite to <hi>Paris,</hi> to take <hi>Giffords</hi> examination, whoſe impriſonment they had there procured: and withall, they cauſed all ſuch as anie way relied vpon them, to take their oath before the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor generall, that in their conſcience they though <hi>Morga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> to be a traitor and a ſpie: vnto the taking of which oath alſo they laboured earneſtly with ſundrie others, which (they not hauing their conſcience ſo ſaleable) refuſed &amp; vtterly denied to doo: yet in the meane time while theſe things were in hand, they wrought ſo with their forged accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that <hi>Morgan</hi> was clapt cloſe priſoner in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dungeon, called the <hi>Truerenborche,</hi> where til the D. of <hi>Parmas</hi> death he remained: at which time, as it is ſaid, he was ſet at libertie, and liueth now with the Biſhop of <hi>Cuſano.</hi> Vpon his apprehenſion there were aboue thirtie ſeuerall ciphers found in his cloſet, in which, abroade in the world he correſponded with great perſonages: and withall a Letter which hee had newly written to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Dunglane,</hi> verie defamatory againſt the perſon of the D. of <hi>Parma:</hi> which incenſed the Duke exceedingly againſt him, &amp; was, without doubt, the chiefeſt cauſe of his long impriſonment, for otherwiſe it is thought hee wold eaſily haue ouerpaſſed the calumniation of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. In fine, theſe two factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue ſought to ouerthrow one anothers credit in the chiefeſt courts of chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom, opening of either ſide ſuch foule matters, and toſsing to &amp; fro ſuch filthie &amp; ſlanderous defamations, that al men crie out againſt them both, holding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee traitors, &amp; men of no fidelitie. So that vndoubtedly I cannot but thinke him diſtracted of his wits, that hauing meanes to lieu elſe where quietly, wil make himſelf a partie in theſe partialities and contentions, which whoſoeuer liueth

                  <p>But the pretieſt of all is, to ſee how ſmoothly they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the matter with you in England, abuſing your ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie with the ſubtiltie of their words, and the holynes of their, apparance. They make you and the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of England beleeue, that what practiſes &amp; drifts ſo euer they take in hand, are all for the zeale of religion and aduancement of the Catholike cauſe. And you ſilly ſoules thinke all they ſaie to bee Goſpell; whereas (God wot) religion is the leaſt matter of a thouſand that they thinke vppon. The onely point they aime at, beeing loſt companions at home,<note place="margin">The drifte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Engliſh traitors abroad:</note> is to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues great where they are, &amp; that by making you hazard your liues, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and credits, and to that ende they are alwayes breeding of practiſes and conſpiracies, both within and without the realme, caring not what ſucceſſe they take: if they proue well, then they will haue the praiſe, merite, honor, and rewarde thereof: if otherwiſe, then they ſaie their good will muſt bee accepted, in greate matters the attempt is ſufficient. And thereby they thinke to win the reputation to be accounted great ſtate men, and contriuers of waightie matters, not caring in the meane time for the ſecuritie of them by whome they worke, as appeareth by the example and fall of many braue gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of England, whome by their treacherous practiſes they haue brought to ruine and deſtruction. They verie well knew that when they firſt began to ſet abroach the matter of <hi>Babbington</hi> &amp; his diſloiall confederats, that the effecting thereof in ſuch ſorte as they had plotted it, was altogether vnpoſsible,<note place="margin">Babington and his confederats.</note> as <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spaniſh Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, told <hi>Ballard</hi> the prieſt, their inſtrument in contriuing the ſame, when he was at firſt in <hi>Paris</hi> brought vnto him

                  <p>Let therefore all the gentlemen of England, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Catholiks, (who in regard of their religion &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, are by them likelieſt to be inſnared) take heed &amp; beware of hauing any thing to do with this peſtilent and factious race of people, for they ſpeak ſo deuoutly, looke ſo ſmoothly, and write with ſuch counterfeted grauity and holines, that it is hard for anie man to eſchue theyr deadly baits, vnles he do firſt knowe the falſhood &amp; tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie vnder which they doo colour and ſhroud them.

                  <p>And yet for all ſo many tragicall ends of their bloudie and traiterous indeuours, are they moued with anie the leaſt ſparke of repentance. Neither hath the ruine of ſo many of you their countrimen, wrought and contriued

But ſome may perchance demand of me what their meaning herein may be, or what credite, commoditie, or gaine might haue allured them to enter in theſe beforeſayd ſo wicked &amp; deteſtable inclinations. For anſwere hereunto: firſt I told you that ſo they might be accounted and reputed for great ſtate-men, high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and of deepe action, to procure that reputation &amp; credit, they care not whoſe eſtate of life they indanger.

Marie againe on the otherſide, conſidering that the moſt part of them are but baſe defamed companions, of no birth or liuing, and that there are in England many Gentlemen of the ſame religion of great qualitie and houſes, that wold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to haue ſuch mates preferred before them in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or degree. They haue gone by al means poſsible they can, about with their practiſes and colorable deuiſes to

The like alſo they threatned in their bookes, to all ſuch, as well noble men as others, that ſhuld after the landing of the catholike armie perſiſt in armes againſt the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:8993:40"/>of, nor ſo much as once to think of them. I do not much miſlike the ſimple ſincerenes of your intention, but yet if I might counſell you, I would wiſh you to looke a litle better into the matter, before you ingage your ſelf in any ſuch courſe. Wiſe men are not carried awaie with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of things, but in matters that are doubtfull, doo alwaies ſuſpect the worſt. The worſt wine hath alwayes the faireſt Iuy buſh: the fouleſt ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts lie vnder the beſt and rankeſt graſſe: and the birdes that flie vnto the bait without regarding the lime twigs, are eaſilieſt intangled.

Vndoubtedly the loue and zeale which the king ſeemeth to beare vnto thoſe of our nation is great, in inuiting them to ſtudie in his countries, &amp; to that end preparing ſuch conuenient places for them. But I haue often heard ſaie, that the fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flatteries of an enemy are farre more dangerous tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the frouning apprehenſion of a friend.<note place="margin">The flatterie of an enemy more dangerous than the reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a friend</note>

Likewiſe he muſt ſolemnly make a vow of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his ſuperior, directly &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction, to go whether ſoeuer he ſhal ſend him, &amp; to gouerne himſelf according to ſuch inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as he ſhal receiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame not to ſwarue, though it ſhould coſt him his life.

                  <p>Now to the third point of my diſcourſe, concerning the miſlike which ſundrie of you haue of her maieſties gouernment, and the ſtate of our country at this preſent, pretending that to bee the cauſe why ye tranſport your ſelues into the king of Spaines dominions, who in your conceit, are gouerned with much more mildneſſe and tranquilitie: I will by comparing the one with the other, as neere as I can, let you ſee the difference betweene

                  <p>As neere as I can geſſe, this your diſliking proceedeth of two points,<note place="margin">The cauſes of theyr diſlykyng the gouerment,</note> the one that your laws are too rigorouſlie &amp; ſeuerely executed againſt ſuch as profeſſe the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion: the other, that the aduerſarie hath buzzed a feare into your heads, making you beleeue that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our ſtate are too feeble to reſiſt ſo mightie and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant an enemie as the Spaniſh king: whoſe mighty trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, many dominions, and armies of men, they magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the skies, &amp; therfore perchance you couet to ioyne betimes with that partie which you do thinke aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, for your future ſecuritie and aduancement.

                  <p>For her Maieſty knoweth, her honorable Councel knoweth, yea, and I &amp; the whole world knoweth, that the comming of theſe Seminaries, Prieſts, and Ieſuits, to reconcile men (as they tearme it) to the obedience of the Romane church, is directly and abſolutely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate and diuert their mindes from her maieſtie, and to incline them to be readie to aſsiſt anie enemy either within or without the realme, that ſhall colour his cauſe vnder the pretext of religion. Her maieſty, I ſay, and counsell, and all good ſubiects knowing this, and foreſeeing the danger that might thereof inſue, forbad by act of Parliament, theſe ſortes of ſeditious people

                  <p>But this lenitie wrought rather contempt then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, for theſe men contemning the grauitie of our lawes, and not thinking any to be obeied, but ſuch as they make themſelues, came ſtill into the realme as faſt as before. Great numbers of them were taken and empriſoned, whom though her maieſtie deſeruedly, and with greate Iuſtice, (eſpecially the daily miſchiefe ſtirred vp within the realme, by their malitious practiſes conſidered) might haue executed as Traytors and Rebels, yet the greateneſſe of her princely clemencie and compaſſion, was ſo vnwilling to come vnto extreames, that ſhe cauſed them al once more to be pardoned, and to be put out of the realme but with expreſſe commaundement, neuer to returne in the like ſorte: in doing otherwiſe, they ſhould not attend any other than the rigor of the lawes.

                  <p>Where is then this rigour you ſpeake of?

                  <p>Among innumerable other examples hereof that I could alleadge, I will onely acquaint you with one. At execution of which, a Gentleman of good credite in the lowe Countries, ſware vnto mee that hee was preſent, and that it was in manner as followeth.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Giles Rat,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Antwarpe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The execution of a Dutchman &amp; an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Spaine for religion</note> and by his occupation a ſhoomaker, who ſome fewe yeeres ſince going into Spaine about ſome buſineſſe pertaining to his trade, was apprehended &amp; brought before the inquiſitors, onely for that hee had ſmiled at the image of our Ladie, which as they ſayde he had done in deriſion, and therefore preſently condemned him to the fire, amd with him likewiſe an Engliſhman for the like cauſe, whoſe name the Gentleman that ſawe them burned, knew not: but hee tolde mee, that at the time of their execution there mounted vp into a ſcaffolde there by two Ieſuites, forbidding the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, vppon paine of excommunication, to praie for them, ſaying that they had deliuered them both ouer inbodie and ſoule to the deuill, as thoſe that died ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtnate and wilfull heretikes.</p>
                  <p>Surely by theſe examples it appeareth, that hee would bee loth to tollerate in Spaine anie that ſhould go about to ſeduce his people with anie contrarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:44"/>eſpeciallye miniſters, of which if anie ſuch ſhould fall into his handes, it is likely he would not ſo often pardon them as the Queene hath done the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>This is in deede extreame tyrannie, and not that which her maieſtie vſeth, who is alwaies readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into grace and fauour, thoſe of whome ſhe hath anie hope that they will become good ſubiectes,<note place="margin">The mercifull offer of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes after theyr condemnation.</note> and hath, as I haue heard, offered (after that by lawe they were condemned) her princely mercie and fauour to ſome of them, if they wold haue promiſed to become good ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>O howe different is this proceeding from that, whoſe mildneſſe and clemencie they ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend!

The Ieſuite amazed at ſo ſtrange a ſpeech, failed not to tell him, that the obſeruation of ſuch a vow was much more wicked, than the breach thereof, and withall, that the performance would procure both his bodies death, and his ſoules damnation. The ſouldier replied, that hee knewe his wordes to bee true, and withall, that hee had in his minde alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy forecaſt this and much more: neuertheleſſe, that his minde was ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairefull and dreadfull reſolution, that it was not in his power to withdrawe his thoughts from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

Whereupon the Ieſuite ſeeing that it was not in his force to diuert him from that, vppon which, to his ſeeming, his minde had ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolued, requeſted him yet, that hee would the next morning at eight of the clocke meet him in the ſame place againe, and hee would conferre further with him. Which the ſouldier promiſing, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite preſently repaired to the Treaſurer, and after his ſolemne oath taken neuer to proſecute any thing againſt the fellow, acquainted him with what had happened, forgetting not withall to dilate much of the wilde countenaunce and amazed geſture of the fellow, and therefore wiſhed him, not by any means to hazard a thing of ſo great valew as his life vppon the franticke reſolution of a deſperate ſouldier. The Treaſurer not daring to apprehend the fellowe, leſt thereupon danger might haue enſued to the Ieſuite for reuealing a thing vttered in confeſsion, and withall, reſtrained by his oathe, requeſted him to bring him with him the next morning, which the Ieſuite not failing to doe, they found a fellow rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the hall to receiue them with money, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſouldiers lyberanſa, gaue him preſently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which was of ſuch vertue, that it aſſoiled him of his vow.</p>

But preſently the ſmell of the <hi>Spanish</hi> golde that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his Cardinalles had in their purſes, ſtrake him into ſuch a calenture, that much againſt his will hee was faine to take his leaue of the worlde, and leaue behinde him vneffected many great matters, on the which hee had in his minde determined. So that although the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> be at great charge with theſe noble pillers of the Church, yet you ſee, that ſometimes of their ſides it is not vnrequited, ſeeing that for his ſake, they are contented ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to betray their Maiſter.

And I doe not thinke him to bee in anie thing more penurious than in the want of men: for as for <hi>Spaine, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> vppon which his onely force doth conſiſt, and which are his principalleſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Store-houſes of men, it is ſufficiently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen that his Drummes haue gone at the leaſt the ſpace of a whole yeare together beating vppe and downe, according as the manner is, to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſixe thouſand men, and thoſe all Sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, Hedgepikers, and ſuch idle trewantly rogues, the moſt part of the which hee is forced to putte into garriſons for the ſpace at the leaſt of a yeare or twoo, to the ende to faſhion them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee doe ſend them to ſeruice; for, vpon their firſt leuie, you did neuer in all your life ſee more ſeely ſnakes than they are.

                     <p>Let them onely wince, that feele their galled backe rubbed (for my part) I would to God, and I wiſh it vnfainedly, that this poore aduertiſement of mine, might leaue as a cataplaſme or medicine to remedy and cure the rankleing of their malladie and diſeaſe, the which if it may not be, but that in recompence of my friendly, honeſt, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intention, they ſhall reward mee with a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and detracting cenſure, I ſhall not therewith be much grieued, but rather greatly comforted, in hauing made my ſelfe woorthy of their malice, the which ſeeing they haue not ſpared to powre out in ſuch opprobrious termes againſt Princes and men of aucthority, it were folly in me to thinke to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, or want of courage to regarde it.</p>

                     <p>Moreouer her Maieſtie ſeeing the lamentable and moſt pittifull cauſe of her diſtreſſed neighbours and allies, finding no other poſsible meanes by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſuites, meſſages, and ſundry Ambaſſadours which ſhee moſt honourably ſent vnto the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> for pacifying the ſaide troubles, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſaide King, and thoſe ſometimes his ſaide ſubiectes hath been inforced to take pittie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of their moſt miſerable &amp; afflicted eſtate and diſtreſſe, and for their releefe, to her exceſſiue and almoſt importable charges, to vndertake a moſt iuſt, godly, and charitable defenſiue warre againſt
<pb facs="tcp:8993:82"/>thoſe that daily ſeeke the bloud, liues, goods, lands, and liberties of the inhabitants of the ſaid diſtreſſed Nations, ſince which being publiſhed, I thinke it not onely vnlawfull, but a moſt heinous and capitall crime and offence for any of her Maieſties ſubiectes to ſerue on the contrary part.</p>
                     <p>It ſhall be good for you and all other good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of her Maieſties to remember, that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being had by her Maieſty and her moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prudent councell, of the looſeneſſe of many of her ſubiects, and ſmall reſpect they had to her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and countrey, and as little to their owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, her Maieſtie hath cauſed to be publiſhed and ſet foorth diuers lawes, ordinances, proclamations and inhibitions, whereby all her ſubiects (except know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en marchants and ſtrangers are ſtraightly forbidden to paſſe the ſeas into any forraine partes without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall licence of her Maieſtie. Therefore if you or any other of her Maieſties ſubiects, ſhall nowe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to paſſe the ſeas without lawfull licence, there is no reaſon why you ſhould expect any other than the rigour of the lawes and iuſtice, and to be holden guiltie of caſes capitall, eſpecially ſuch as ſhall ſerue vnder ſo open and profeſſed an enemy to the crown and ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Further, I pray you to haue in conſideration, that when I came ouer hither, the caſe ſo ſtoode, as al Gentlemen of any qualitie or merit, were grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued, and employed in good and honourable ſeruices; whereas ſince the Spaniard hath profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe an open enemy to her Maieſtie and the
<pb facs="tcp:8993:83"/>ſtate of her realme, hee hath had all Engliſh men in very baſe account, being iealous and extreamely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious of thoſe that be moſt inward with him, and who for his ſake haue make ſhipwracke, not onely of their honour and credit, but alſo of their loyalty, duty, and allegeance to her Maieſtie and their natiue countrey; examples whereof are infinit, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched in my diſcourſe before ſet downe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there is of late crept into that Nation with a commaunding authoritie, a prowd; inſolent; and factious company of Ieſuites, and with them a conſorted crew of other practiſing buſie people, all of them malicious enemies to her Maieſtie, and to their owne countrey, vile and pernicious inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Spanſh</hi> King and his adherents, who daily (as it is manifeſt to them that haue knowledge and experience of them and their actions) ſeeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the vtter ruine, pulling downe, and deſtruction of her Maieſtie and their countrey: He therefore that doeth thinke to liue among theſe ſubtile and dangerous people, in any credite or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, let him, as hee woorthily doth deſerue, be accounted beſide his wittes, or elſe as diſobedient and traiterous to almightie God, her Maieſtie, and his countrey.</p>
                     <p>As for my part, howſoeuer in my yoong yeeres affected to learne languages, and to ſee the warres and faſhions of forraine places, yet when I perceiued that the matter beganne to concerne her Maieſtie, and withall, to looke into the drift and conueyance whereto their practiſes tended, preſently abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:8993:83"/>and vtterly reiecting the merit of my long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſuch hopes and preferrements the which I might as well as any man elſe of my qualitie of my Nation haue pretended, and perchance ſhoulde as ſoone haue obtained, I made humble interceſsion to her Maieſtie my moſt honoured princeſſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lady for my returne, which of her royall and accuſtomed benignitie ſhe gratiouſly graunted: ſo that beſides the vnfained prayer which I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe to ſend to the heauens from the depth of a moſt faithfull affection for the continuance of her bleſſed eſtate and happineſſe, I take God to recorde, that there is not in this world any thing that I more thirſt after than an occaſion to make the world wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the deſire I haue to do her ſeruice; and ſo concluding, I beſeech God, that as her vertues are infinit, ſo her ioyes may be endleſſe. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Firſt, I will directe my ſpeeches to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, deſirous to ſerue here in <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhewing them in what point of their hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations they doo faile and are deceiued.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to our credulous Papiſtes at home, vpon whoſe groſeneſſe and ſimplicitie, our rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous traitors heere abroade doo build their chiefeſt foundations of all their villanies, whom while they entertaine with vaine expectations, in the meane time with ſpies, Prieſts, and traitours, which they daily ſend ouer, they abuſe with trecherous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to the irrepiable ruine and ouerthrowe of them and theirs. Thirdly, becauſe many of our countrie
<pb facs="tcp:8993:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>men liuing in great happineſſe at home, doo yet in their conceits miſlike, ſurfetting with eaſe, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate they liue in, and what withall, the manner of her Maieſties moſt gracious and mercifull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, I haue thought it my dutie ſomewhat to expreſſe theſe few things which haue come to my knowledge, touching the innumerable benefites &amp; bleſsings with which it hath pleaſed God to adorn her royall Maieſtie, together with the flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of that noble ſoyle, ſince the time of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties raigne, ſo flouriſhing with peace, proſperitie, and abundance in glorie of warres, ſo renowmed and victorious in artes, ſo curious and excellent in iuſtice, euen to the verie enemie, ſo admirable, and (which ſurpaſſeth all the reſt) in the free, ſweet, and comfortable vſe of the true religion: ſo aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſed and fortunate, that I haue hearde the verie Spaniardes themſelues ſaie, they feare Ieſus Chriſt is become a proteſtant. Withal, I make ſome compariſon betweene this and the tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Spaniſh tyrant, his cruell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane vſage of his miſerable ſubiects, theyr abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of their priuiledges, and in fine, the vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable bondage, ſlauerie, and deſolate deſpayre in which they liue languiſhing. A matter though farre vnfit for mee to handle or treate, but worthie of the moſt graue and experienced men of qualitie and higheſt degree, yet conſidering I ſhall not preſume to treate of matters of high ſtate or ſecrets, but ſuch as euerie good ſubiect may find and pick out of the heroicall actions of the one, and the tyrannicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
<pb facs="tcp:8993:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the other, both don in the appearance of the world, I hope and ſo with all lowlyneſſe moſt humblie deſire her gracious and moſt benigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to pardon mee, if I come farre ſhort of that which men fitter for the handling therof could ſaie or intreat. And ſo moſt humbly alſo make petition, that I may therin be cenſured according to the loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all zeale I beare to her moſt princely Maieſtie, and not to the baſeneſſe and ſimplicity of my ſtile or the handling thereof.</p>
                  <p>But to come to my Diſcourſe, to the end that you and the reſt of your opinion, may cleerely and plainly diſcerne thoſe things which hetherto your eyes blinded with the vaile of partialitie, haue not bin able to view: I will begin with the good vſage, honor and aduancement that you and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen addicted to this ſeruice are heere to expect, bringing vnto you for example, ſundrie braue and worthie Gentlemen, Captaines, and ſouldiers, that haue taken the lyke courſe before you, wherby you ſhal perceiue it is not all gold that gliſtreth, but that whatſoeuer ſhew the Spaniard maketh vnto vs, yet in his hart he mortally abhorreth vs, &amp; by all means poſsible ſeeketh our deſtruction, ruine, &amp; ſubuerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it euidently appeareth by his vſage of troupes and companies of our nation that haue ſerued his. For example: at the ſiege of <hi>Antwarpe</hi> there came vnto him vnder the conduct of <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> a troup of ſix thouſand, the talleſt and beſt appointed ſouldiers, that euer I remember to haue ſeene in all my lyfe, theyr comming beeing the onely cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:8993:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the towne was ſo ſoone deliuered vnto him as it was. For whereas the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> laie vnder the walles of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> with ſufficient force and moſt deliberate reſolution to ſuccour the ſayd towne of <hi>Antwarpe</hi> vpon his mutinie, fearing further incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, he marched awaie with his whole camp, leauing the enemie now battering the towne, who ſeeing themſelues fruſtrate of their expected hope, preſently rendered the ſame to the Duke of Parma. But how were they recompenced? VVithin one yeere they were l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>h for hunger, which ſome of them ſeeking to releeue, by foreranging out vpon the Countrie, foure and twentie of them were taken and carried to <hi>Antwarpe,</hi> of whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they were the chiefeſt, and there openlye hanged in the market place. Whereas all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had libertie to robbe and ſteale, and do what they liſt. Another troupe of them of thirtie, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth, and lying in a village neere <hi>Poppering</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> a company of Spaniards hearing of them, came into the village where they were, and after friendly and ſouldierlye ſalutation of each ſide, as they were all making merrie together, on a ſodayne the Spapiardes tooke them at aduauntage vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and moſt trecherouſly and inhumanely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them euerie one. Sundrie complaints were made to the Duke by the friendes of thoſe that were thus murthered, and by the Captaines of the Regiment, but there could bee no remedie nor iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice obtained. But to make amendes, becauſe they would bee the cleanlier ridde of the reſidue of this
<pb facs="tcp:8993:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>poore miſerable troupe, the campe beeing then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Winockbergen,</hi> they made them two little ſortes of purpoſe, in which they willingly placed them in the vtmoſt quarter of the whole camp, and neereſt confining to the towne, to the end they might haue all their throates cut, as in deed they had verie few nightes after. At which time the enemie aſſaulting them with great furie, and they defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt manfully aboue the ſpace of an houre, in ſuch ſort as the alarum paſſed through the whole campe, yet they were neuer releeued with any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour at all, inſomuch that the greateſt part of them beeing ſlaine in defence, the enemie at laſt entered and put the reſidue to the ſwoord.</p>
                  <p>To rehearſe vnto you the ſundrie and ſeuerall calamities that theſe poore men, as well Captaines as ſouldiers endured, during the ſmall time of that theyr vnfortunate ſeruice, eſpeciallye at <hi>Ganskecke, Aske,</hi> and <hi>Grauer,</hi> would ſeeme (I am ſure) vnto you for the vnſpeakable ſtraungeneſſe thereof, ſcarcely credible, for they neuer receiued all the time of their ſeruice anie one moneths paie. I haue ſeene Lieutenants and Enſignes of them go vp and down the campe begging their bread, couered only with olde mantles about their ſhoulders, and haue my ſelfe releeued ſome of them. Shortly after came <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> who brought with him ſir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beeing well neere a thouſand, as tall and well appointed men as were in Europe, whoſe ſeruice, how meritorious and beneficiall it was vnto the Spaniardes, I leaue to their iudgementes that know
<pb facs="tcp:8993:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Countrie. For by rendering of <hi>Aloſt</hi> vnto him, they were the occaſion that he got <hi>Darmounde</hi> the <hi>Saſſe,</hi> the fortes of <hi>Leiskins hooke,</hi> Saint <hi>Anthonies,</hi> and Saint <hi>Margarets,</hi> the beſt part of the land of <hi>Waſt,</hi> &amp; in manner <hi>Gaunt</hi> it ſelfe, as the ſequel ſhewed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which ſeruice, they were wythin two yeeres ſpace, what with hunger, the gallowes, &amp; rigorous dealing, conſumed and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And laſt at <hi>Stalbrooke,</hi> euen againſt the yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of <hi>Antwarp,</hi> when all other nations were to receiue their count and reckoning, they onely were infamouſly caſhierd without anie one monethes pay. And which of all other is moſt monſtrous and ſcarſe credible, whereas ſome of the Captaines, not long before had made them of theyr owne purſes new and fayre Enſignes, thoſe Enſignes were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken awaie from thoſe that bare them, and detained: Which abuſe and wrong, though captain <hi>Treſham</hi> and the other Captaines complained off to the Duke with great proteſtations, yet they coulde neuer obtaine anie reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat before this time, when the whole campe was at the ſiege of <hi>Dermound</hi> paide two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, they onely though of all others moſt trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the trenches, wading euerie night boſome high to theyr waſt, and hauing had more men ſlaine in that ſiege than anie other regiment in the whole campe, could not receiue one pennie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had paſſed in muſter with the reſt, and ſome of the Captaines bribed the Commiſſarie, thinking thereby to make a great hand. But in ſtead
<pb facs="tcp:8993:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>of money, when they ſhewed the Duke, they were ſcornfully by him turned of to the Contadores, of whom they receiued the moſt baſe &amp; opprobrious ſpeeches that euer were giuen ſoldiers, &amp; were in fine reiected without euer receiuing one halfpeny. And laſtly, when the Regiment was caſt, whereas the pay of a reformed Captaine amongſt them, of what Nation ſoeuer he bee, is fortie crownes, they giue onely to our Engliſh captaines fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a moneth. Not long before it chanced that one of the Captains, whoſe name was <hi>Edward Vincent,</hi> was taken in a skirmiſh by the enemie at <hi>Pernence,</hi> and ſet at ranſome at a hundred and fiftie poundes, to make which raunſome, his father being then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> a poore olde man of ſeuenty yeres of age, fell vpon his knees before the Duke, weeping and imploring his help. But in ſted of yeelding him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, the Duke badde take awaie the olde dronken foole: the griefe whereof ſtrake the old man ſo to the heart, that he went home and dyed within ſixe dayes, and his ſonne for lacke of his raunſome was ſhortly after hanged at <hi>Perges. Pigot</hi> himſelfe being ſome three yeeres ſince taken, and <hi>Barne,</hi> betweene <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> were neuer releeued with anie one pennie towardes their charges or raunſomes, <hi>Pigot</hi> was ſuffred miſerably to end his daies in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo had <hi>Barne</hi> alſo, but that his wife, by her ſolicitation, found ſuch fauour among his priuate friends, that ſhe got as much as paide his raunſome, but neuer could obtaine one pennie of the Duke, though ſhee were an importunate ſutor vnto him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8993:92"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, came ſir <hi>W. Standley</hi> and <hi>R. Yorke</hi> rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto the King the towne of <hi>Deuenter,</hi> &amp; fort of <hi>Sutphen,</hi> the one with a regiment of foote, the other with a company of lances. Let vs ſee howe the one and the other was vſed. Firſt, ſir <hi>William Standley</hi> was confirmed gouernour of the Towne, hee rendered, and his regiment left there in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the receit of two moneths pay. For a while he liued in the greateſt applauſe that might be: Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> was written to to ſend downe Prieſts to inſtruct this religious regiment: hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Pope thereof, who wrote ioyntly to the king to be good vnto this regiment. VVhich being well and liberally intreated, as they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> a Seminary of ſchollers to pray and write for the catholike cauſe of our Country, ſo this conducted by ſo worthy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike a Gentleman as ſir <hi>William Standley</hi> was, might be a continuall nurſery, and ſeminary of ſouldiours to fight for the ſame. Downe came Prieſtes thicke and three fold, from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> many Maſſes, and much preaching there was: Gentlemen from all parts drew downe thither, in hope of this good payment, and golden world that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was talked of. But what folowed? within ſhort ſpace, to weaken then number, three of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies vnder colour of ſeruice, were cunningly drawen out of the Towne by <hi>Verdugo Haaltephen,</hi> neuer from that time after being ſuffred to returne to it againe: &amp; within a while after ſir <hi>William</hi> him ſelfe with the remnant, was commanded vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:8993:92"/>lyke colour of ſeruice, to come foorth, beeing tolde that hee ſhoulde preſently returne into it againe. And by this fine meanes was caſed of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch goods as he and his ſouldiers lefte, were ſpoiled &amp; made bootie of. And ſithence that time, his ſeminary ſoldiers, with al their religion, were neuer truſted in any towne, nor neuer ſhalbe I warrant them. From thence they were preſently drawen downe into <hi>Brabant,</hi> where they wintered in the field without monie, and in ſuch great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and pouertie, that tenne weekes together their chiefeſt foode and ſuſtenaunce in <hi>Turnolt,</hi> was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poudered acornes, which they founde in cellers. VVhich diet the prieſts not liking of, came to their Coronell to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> who to auoid the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and complaints of his ſouldiers, had gotten him there a lodging, where you ſhould neuer haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his table without a ſquadron of Prieſts. Some did wonder, ſo worthy a ſouldier could ſuffer their indignities, which to auoide, ſome yeeres ſince hee went into Spaine: partlye to ſecure vnto himſelfe ſome eſtate of liuing, of which he now conſidering this dealing, began to doubt: partly by the inuitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ieſuites, with which order hee is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly inchanted, &amp; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholy ſubiected: who dealt for him in ſuch ſort with the Cardinall, that he preſently ſent <hi>Parſons</hi> away into Spaine, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the King of his worthineſſe, vertue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the ſea coaſtes of England, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his intelligence about Irelande, which in truth hee preſumeth to bee verie greate. <hi>Parſons</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8993:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>plaide his part in ſuch ſort, that ſir <hi>William</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent for: who vpon his ariuall, did what he could, to perſwade the king to ſend forces for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: but belyke there was not ſuch credite giuen him as hee expected, inſomuch that he wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>H. Holt</hi> the Ieſuit in <hi>Bruſels</hi> (which is one of thoſe on whom he chiefly relyeth) of great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſignifieng, that his entertainment was far colder than he expected. VVithin ſhort ſpace after, he was ſent downe to the kings nauie, lying at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> where as yet he remaineth. In the meane time his regiment began to drop and droupe awaie, in ſuch ſort, that what for lacke of ſuſtenance, &amp; what for ill vſage, the number of them was melted to an hundred and fiftie: which baſe and villanous vſage the graueſt and wiſeſt of his Captains ſeeing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially abhorring the trecherous practiſes of their Coronell, made by ſecrete meanes humble inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion to her moſt gracious MAISTIE to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don theyr offences committed, and to grant them libertie to liue in their Country: which of her moſt princely and royall benignitie ſhee graunted, ſo as now they liue here in honeſt and good ſort, &amp; can teſtifie all this which I haue ſayd to be true.</p>
                  <p>Hauing gotten ſir <hi>William</hi> out of <hi>Deuenter,</hi> yet <hi>Yorke</hi> ſtill remained a blemiſh in their eie, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais, notwithſtanding their baſe vſage, ſtil flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; bare his head aloft, ranging ouer the whole countrie with his Companie, bringing in daylye many great and rich booties: Him therefore fairly on a daie at dinner, they cauſed to bee poyſoned,

His breath was no ſooner out of his bodie, but <hi>Fiorias</hi> a Spaniard, and <hi>Vandenberg,</hi> the newe gouernour of <hi>Deuenter</hi> ruſhte into his lodging to breake vp his coffers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which being withſtoode by <hi>Yorkes</hi> lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Edward Boncer,</hi> and his brother, they cauſed their gards at noone dayes to enter in vpon them, and to murther them both in their owne preſence: which done, they brake vp his coffers, took out his iewels, plate and mony, of which they found great ſtore, appropriating the ſame to their townes vſe, which he by Teſtament had giuen to a little youth his nephew, being now at this preſent in <hi>England.</hi> Laſtly, they chaſed his whole companie out of the towne, and ſpoiled their baggage at the gates. The poore ſouldiers beeing thus inhumanely depriued of their Captaine and Lieutenant, and ſeeing them ſelues ſo vilely dealt with, repaired to <hi>Verſlugo</hi> for releefe, who for recompence preſentlye caſhierd them all without receit of one pennie.</p>
                  <p>Afterwardes they gaue out and publiſhed, that <hi>Yorke</hi> was poiſoned by ſubornation of the counſel of England: but, if there had bene no other proofes (as there were infinite) yet the ſequele of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, their murthering of his friends, and their rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of his treaſure, ſhewed by whom it was done,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>and whereat they aymed.</p>
                  <p>If theſe examples bee not inough to ſerue the turne, but that perchance you will ſay, he hath delt better with priuate men. If you can name me but any one that he hath raiſed or aduanced to honor, or that liueth richly or welthily in his ſeruice, I wil name you an hundred, that beeing Gentlemen of good houſes and of worthie merite, haue conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, languiſhed, and beene brought to nothing in his ſeruice, ſome of them periſhed &amp; died for lacke of ſuſtenance. You perchance will name <hi>Hugh Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en:</hi> and in good faith hee is the onely man that euer I knew aduanced, credited, or graced in his ſeruice. And yet (God wot) all that hee getteth, is no more than to maintaine him in a meane eſtate and ſhew, with a man only or two to ſerue him. VVhere on the other ſide I will recken you vp of thoſe that are onely for want of thinges neceſsarie, and of pure pouertie conſumed and dead, M. <hi>Copley,</hi> L. <hi>Dacers, Michael Tempeſt,</hi> old <hi>Norton, Tremaine, Stradling, Henrie Carew, Edward Allen, Southwell,</hi> with ſundry others of good race and credite in their Countrie: <hi>Copley</hi> being ſicke at <hi>Beuere,</hi> and in vnſpeakable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe and calamitie, deſired a Gentleman his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, one <hi>Lo. Lewkner,</hi> to beſeech <hi>Pedro de Olane,</hi> who then was treaſurer, to pay him vpon an aſsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which hee had, onely fiue pounds, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at that preſent his life might therewith be ſaued. The Gentleman performed his requeſt with all inſtance and fidelitie, as he hath oftentimes told me, but coulde not obtaine one pennie. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb facs="tcp:8993:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>hee mooued the Duke, but nothing woulde come, ſo that without finding any man that tooke compaſsion of his diſtreſſe, his owne Countrie-men being vnable to helpe him, hee ended his life, though with patience vertuouſly and well, yet the ſtate of ſo honorable a gentleman conſidered, moſt pittifully, and in great miſery.</p>
                  <p>To recite vnto you the names of thoſe that doe yet liue ſo poorely and vncomfortably in his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would bee too long, and therefore take them all in generall (<hi>Charles Paget</hi> onely excepted) and examine them one from an other, from my Lord of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> downeward, euen to the very low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: and if there bee in the whole worlde a more miſerable and diſcontented troupe of Gentlemen than they are, let me neuer be credited in any thing elſe that I ſhall tel you. And becauſe you ſhal your ſelfe the beteer iudge, I will tell you what pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue, of ſuch penſions as the king hath giuen them.</p>
                  <p>They had graunted them at <hi>Bruges</hi> the firſt day of Auguſt, in the yeere one thouſand fiue hundred eighty and eight, a generall <hi>Liberanca,</hi> to receyue three moneths pay a peece of their penſions. Since that time they haue followed the Duke from Towne to Towne, making vnto him ſundrie requeſtes for the payment thereof: but if they haue vntill this preſent day obtayned the ſame, then let mee not be credited in any part of the reſt which I ſhall heere entreate of. In deede ſome ſmall time paſt, <hi>Coſimo</hi> beeing wearyed
<pb facs="tcp:8993:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>with their importunities and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Baptista Spinola</hi> a baker dwelling at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> giuing them his Letter, and ſending the ſame by one <hi>H. Haſlwood,</hi> requeſting him to relieue thoſe diſtreſſed Engliſh Gentlemen, and to buy their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beranca,</hi> which he doubted not but they would ſell good cheap, greatly to his profit: the whole ſumme was ten thouſand crowns, which <hi>Coſimo</hi> promiſed him ſhould be allowed, and paid in the reckoning he had with the king. <hi>Haſlewood</hi> in the name of the reſt, offered him the ſayd ſumme for ſixe hundred. But <hi>Spinola</hi> vtterly refuſed the ſame, ſaying, he wold not take it for two hundred, and withall hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee might not meddle anie more with the king, wiſhing that he had not medled with him ſo much. So that they were fain to returne pennileſſe, and doo at this inſtant liue in ſo poore and pitifull ſort, that truly my hart grieueth to ſee it, inſomuch that I knew a Gentleman that ſolde his part there, being foure and twentie pounds, for three pounds. But perchance you will ſaie, he giueth great penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and entertaineth manie of our Nation: it is true in deede, in ſhewe hee doth ſo, and therewith doth bleare the worldes eyes wyth a ſhew of great liberalitie. But his payment and vſage conſidered, a (God is my iudge and witneſſe) I ſpeake vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I account it a farre happier eſtate to bee a doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in that your bleſſed ſoile, than to be heere penſioner to the king of <hi>Spaine.</hi> I leaue the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth thereof, to thoſe that haue tryed it: you haue many amongſt you, confer with them
<pb facs="tcp:8993:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>and examine them vppon their conſciences: as for my part, in good faith I cannot imagin cauſe why he entertaineth vs, vnles it be to vſe vs as ſtales, to allure others, conſidering the hatred that he &amp; his beare vs, and ſo vnder the diſſembled colour of a falſe affection, to ouerthrow vs all at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I dare boldly ſay, becauſe through the conference I haue had with them, I doe know aſſuredly, that euen thoſe of our nation which doe moſt ſerue his turne, howſoeuer in outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they ſeem for ſome particular cauſes to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and extoll his liberalitie, yet in their owne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceits they do imagin &amp; know nothing in the world to be more reprochfull, baſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, than to be an Entertain do in the king of Spaines ſeruice. As for example: you ſhall eaſilie ſee what account is made of them. At ſuch time as preparation was made at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> for the voyage of Englande, when they all expected to bee made knights, coronels, captaines, and conducters of the armie, and to be filled with crownes, they were ſo farre from thoſe matters with which they flattered themſelues, that in ſtead of being honored and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced, they were the onelie reiected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned people that followed the Court, all men beeing releeued with ſome moneths paie (they onely excepted) and which is more, whereas they mooued the Duke ſundry times to know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how hee woulde diſpoſe of them in this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, telling him beſides, that vpon the wel vſage of them depended much matter of importaunce, as
<pb facs="tcp:8993:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>the alluring &amp; drawing to them other gentlemen of their kinſmen and friends, and vpon hope of the like good vſage, honour, and aduancement, woulde bee able to doe great ſeruice vpon their landing: where contrariwiſe, in ſeeing them come ouer ſo poore in ſhew, without credit, mony, or armes, lyke lacke is, for ſo were the words of their requeſt, it would be a cauſe to terrifie them from vndertaking any ſuch courſe. They were by the Duke ſcornefully and with deriſion reiected, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did hee vouchſafe to giue them any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, than onely that hee would thinke vpon it. But on the night that they thought to embarke, he departed, leauing them all behind, not thinking them any way woorthy to be called vppon, or to be taken with him. VVherupon the lord <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Paget,</hi> and ſundry others, layd their heads together, and made their complaint to the duke of <hi>Paſtrana,</hi> by whom they were as baſely and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled as by the other, inſomuch as a great Spaniard ſtanding by, asked them whether they thought the king of Spaine not puiſant enough to winne England, without them and their friends: Vpon which anſwere the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> that verily thought hee ſhoulde haue beene made one of the priuy Councell, and now finding himſelfe to bee had in ſo ſmall account, conceiued ſuch an inward griefe, that for that time forward hee neuer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till his dying day. Sir <hi>William Standley</hi> alſo tooke it in ſuch heauy and diſdainefull ſorte, that he was not called to be counſell of warres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="tcp:8993:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>hee preſumed, and ſo gaue out, that no man in the army knewe more, or was better able in this voiage than himſelf, that he ſequeſtred himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Country, and came malecontent, and hired an houſe in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where hee liued a moſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly lyfe foure or fiue moneths, and oftentimes would burſt out into ſuch impaſsionate ſpeeches, that the world verily imagined he would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe into a cloyſter.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the loue the Spaniarde beareth vs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the ſpeeches hee dayly vſeth in publike aſſemblyes concerning vs. Once ſeeing certayne Engliſh-men paſſe by, as they ſtoode a great many of them in a ring, (as they vſe) together vppon the bridge in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> they ſayde, They wondered what the king made with ſuch vermin in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, one of them ſwearing a great oath, that looke how many Engliſh-men there were in the Lowe countries, there were ſo many ſpies and traitours. Another ſayd, it were an almes deede to put them all in ſackes, and throw them into the riuer. I could recite a thouſand more ſuch ſpeeches, but that they are not worth the remembring. They are ſo ielous and ſuſpitious of vs, that if any thing proue vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in their ſeruice, they think it ſtraight to be done by our eſpeciall meanes and intelligence. As vpon the taking of <hi>Axhil</hi> by that braue &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſouldier Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> of worthie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Mondragon</hi> preſently impriſoned <hi>Paget</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtle, tooke away all things whatſoeuer that hee had woorth anie thing, and the reſt
<pb facs="tcp:8993:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>he cauſed his men to ryfle and ſteale, ſaying openly that we all are traitors and ſpies. To confirme the confidence they haue in vs, tell mee what compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Engliſh they haue truſted within theſe ten yeares in gariſon? I am ſure you cannot name one. And whereas ſundry Gentlemen amongſt vs haue inſtantly ſued to haue theyr penſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s granted them in the caſtle of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> or <hi>Gaunt,</hi> becauſe the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there ſomewhat better, no one hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been able to attayne the ſame: ſo vile &amp; baſe is the reckoning they make of vs. I could alledge vnto you many other exampls, of ſundry diſgraces offered vnto our nation, wherby we myght (if we luſt) eaſly diſcouer the hatred they beare vs, the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition they haue of vs, and the danger wherein we ſtand, to haue one day our throates cut. But this I hope, which I haue already rehearſed, ſhall ſuffice fully to aſſure and perſuade you, that here is no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, wealth, or reputation to be gotten, but pouerty, peril, iealouſie, and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee, touching the point of conſcience, and repoſe in religion, if the fame be to be found here, ſuch as you expect. In matter of religion, I will not take it vpon me to diſpute, becauſe it were to digreſſe from my purpoſe, and beſides, I neuer ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed diuinity: only making compariſon between the comfortable freedome of the one, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring ſlauery of the other: laying of the one ſide Indulgences, pilgrimages, forged relikes, fabulous deuiſes, and auricular confeſsions: on the other ſide, the merites and paſsion of our Sauiour Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:8993:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt, the Inuocation of his holy Name, and true penitence proceeding from a contrite heart: on the one ſide mens traditions, and on the other ſide, the ſyncere and holy word of our ſauiour. In thinke the choyſe is not hard to make for him whoſe heart is not hindered wyth obſtinacy and ſelfe will opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But leauing this, and allowing your religion to be good, lets come to the contentment which you might here receyue in free vſage of the ſame, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch other your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men which here do profeſſe the ſame religion. Firſt, I thynke you are not ignorant of the broiles, diuiſions, ſeditions, and factions, which are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: ſome they cal Patriots, ſome Ieſuites, ſome ouer negligent &amp; careleſſe in religion, other ſome ouer pure and hypocriticall, ſome dunces ſtate men: but the notableſt of all theſe factions, is that, betweene our Cardinall Doctour <hi>Allen,</hi> and D. <hi>Lewes</hi> biſhop of <hi>Caſane:</hi> on theſe two parties are all dependant: and ſo muſt you be alſo, if you were here, or otherwiſe cleauing to neyther of them, you ſhoulde bee counted enemy to them both, and ſo within ſhort ſpace might put vp your pipes, for ye ſhould be ſure to be put vp for a ſpie, or at leaſt ſo to be croſſed in all your matters &amp; pretences, that you would quickly, I warant you, be weary of ſuch entertaynment. On the other ſide, embracing the one, what enuy, what defamation, what ſlaunder ſhould you not be ſubiect vnto? On the other ſide, what oathes and ſolemne depoſitions muſt you make? Finally, you would thinke there were no
<pb facs="tcp:8993:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>greater purgatory than to liue among theſe diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

On the other ſide of the Cardinall, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant <hi>Hugh Owen,</hi> with the Ieſuites &amp; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of fauorites. On the other ſide the Biſhop of <hi>Dunglane</hi> a Scottiſh-man, the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he liued, <hi>Charles Paget, Thomas Morgan,</hi> the two <hi>Throgmortons Ra. Liggins, &amp;c.</hi> The beginning heereof aroſe about the Cardinalſhippe, to which both <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi> were competitours: each one for the obtayning thereof applyed his friendes to the vttermoſt, but at length through the inſtant purſuite of the Ieſuites, and of theyr faction, were for euer after mortally hated, all thoſe that had bin waies or fautours to Doctor <hi>Lewes,</hi> but chiefly and among the reſt <hi>Thomas Throgmorton,</hi> who had bin one of the earneſteſt in that purſuite. The Ieſuites ſince haue had many a plucke at him, but <hi>Morgan</hi> beeing wiſe, ſtrengthened himſelfe alwayes wyth ſuch friendes, that they coulde neuer doe him any hurt, but rather ſecretly hee galled them: the which they ſeeing, and peceyuing that that was not the way to bee reuenged of him, they tooke another courſe, and that was this: One euening as hee came from the Church, they cauſed him to bee aſſaulted by a young man called <hi>Gage,</hi> who giuing him on the ſodayne a grieuous blowe vppon the
<pb facs="tcp:8993:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>face, preſently made haſte away, &amp; ſo for that time eſcaped, but was afterwardes by my Lorde <hi>Pagete</hi> meanes and earneſt purſuite apprehended. The Ieſuites and their part ſeemed at the firſt to deny that they had beene the cauſers of that fact, but the ſequele of their proceedings made it moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vnto the whole world. For when <hi>Morgan,</hi> my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and diuerſe of their parte, laboured very inſtantly and with often petitions vnto the Duke, to haue the rigour and ſeuerity of iuſtice to proceede againſt him, of whome they had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this great iniurie, they, to ſtoppe theyr mouthes, and to preuent the miſchiefe that might inſue, found no better meanes than to accuſe <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> of treaſon, laying to his charge ſundry points of treachery touching the Queene of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they accuſed him to haue bene a ſetter on of <hi>Gifford</hi> &amp; his aſsiſtances, in ſuch practiſes as he had vndertaken by ſir <hi>Frances Walſinghams</hi> warrant, &amp; to that end ſent <hi>Chryton,</hi> the Scottiſh Ieſuite, to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> to take <hi>Gyffords</hi> examination. And withall, they made ſome of their adherents to take their oth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Auditour generall, that in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they thought <hi>Morgan</hi> to be a traitour and a ſpie: vnto the taking of which oath alſo, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured earneſtly with ſundry others, which (they not hauing their conſciences ſo ſaleable as ſome of them) had refuſed and vtterly denyed to doe: yet in the meane time while theſe thinges were in hand, with their forged accuſations they wrought ſo, that <hi>Morgan</hi> was apprehended, and clapped
<pb facs="tcp:8993:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>vp in cloſe priſon, whereas yet he remaineth. But this broile hath opened ſuch foule matters, both of the one ſide and of the other, that the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is therewith infamed, and held to be traitors &amp; ſpies: and in good faith, in my iudgment, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</p>
                  <p>Good ſir, take it not in ill part, that I write thus boldly vnto you: for as neere as I can, my endeuor is to let you know, what hell, torment and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is to liue heere, among this vnquiet, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; traiterous crew. I meane not this by them all, for there are among them ſome well diſpoſed and honeſt gentlemen, whom they vſe in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and wicked ſort,, that they make them in a manner wearie of theyr lyues. But the pretieſt of all is, to ſee how ſmoothly they handle the matter with you in England, and how they do abuſe your ſimplicitie. They make you and other Catholykes of England beleeue, that what practiſes and driftes ſo euer they take in hand, are all for the zeale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and aduancement of the Catholike cauſe: &amp; the ſeely ſouls thinke all they ſay is Goſpell, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (God wot) religion is the leaſt matter of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they thinke vpon. The only point they ſhoot at, being loſt Companies at home, is to make them ſelues great heere, and to make you hazarde your liues, reputation and credit: and therefore they are alwais breeding of practiſes and conſpiracies both within and without the realme, caring not what ſucceſſe they take: if they proue wel, then they wil haue the praiſe, merite, honor and reward thereof:
<pb facs="tcp:8993:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>if otherwiſe, then they ſay their good will muſt be accepted, and therewith they thinke to winne the reputation to be counted great ſtate-men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuers of waighty matters: not caring in the mean time, of the ſeueritye of them by whome they worke, as appeareth by the example and fall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny braue Gentlemen of England, whome they by theyr trecherous practiſes haue brought to ruine and deſtruction. They very well knew, that when they firſt began to ſet abroach the matter of <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and his diſloyall confederates, that the effecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof was altogether vnpoſsible, as <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spaniſh embaſſador told <hi>Ballard</hi> the prieſt, their inſtrument in contriuing the ſame, when hee was firſt brought vnto him in <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>C. Paget,</hi> to deſire him with al ſpeed to informe the Kings his maſter of their intention, &amp; withall, that at a day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they might haue ſome force and aſsiſtaunce of men ready to correſpond with them: but that was all one, ſo they might bee counted men of greate reach, and dealers in ſuch high ſtate matters, they ſpared not to proceede in inchanting thoſe poore vnexperienced young Gentlemen, in ſuch forte, as to the whole world is manifeſt, and need not to be recited. Let all Gentlemen in England, eſpeciallye papiſts, take heed and beware of their miſchieuous broode of caterpillers, for they ſpeake ſo deuoutly, looke ſo ſmoothly, and write with ſuch counterfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grauity and holines, that it is hard for any man to eſchue their deadly baits, vnleſſe he thoroughly do firſt know their trechery, vnder which they do
<pb facs="tcp:8993:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>colour and ſhroude them. VVhat hath brought maſter <hi>Shellie</hi> into theſe his extreame troubles and perill of life, if her gracious Maieſtie of her great clemency &amp; merciful diſpoſition had not regarded him wyth the eyes of pitty? Likewiſe what hath brought the late erle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and calamity, and finally to that deſperate and miſerable end, but only theſe outlandiſh practiſes, &amp; their conference with counterfet <hi>Mopo,</hi> I meane <hi>C. Paget,</hi> who was ſent out of France by this ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous troupe, to vndermine and ouerthrowe both the one and the other? VVhat beſides hath beene the cauſe of bringing ſo many other Gentlemen to the loſſe of their liues and liuings, that liued before in eaſe, repoſe, and ſecurity of conſcience: and which is more, were it not that that plot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>triued the death of the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſetting her in continuall practiſe one vpon an other, againſt the ſacred perſon and royal ſtate of our moſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoueraigne Queene, ſo that of violent neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, her Maieſty though vnwilling and with great griefe, at the generall and inſtant petition of al her Graces moſt louing and faithfull ſubiects, whoſe onely weale and comfort dependeth vppon her long lyfe and proſperity, to ſatisfie them, and to preſerue the ſtate of her noble &amp; floriſhing realme in quiet, was conſtrained by cutting off that rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and infected part, to yeelde eaſe, remedy and comfort to the reſt of the whole body. I ſay not this onely of my ſelfe, though I and all the world elſe doe knowe it to be very true: but theſe their
<pb facs="tcp:8993:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>dealings haue made them hatefull and deteſtable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to thoſe of their own religion. For that a freſh Ieſuite tearmeth them all in generall in a Booke, which hee hath written touching the Queene of Scotlandes death, a viperous, miſchieuous, and faithleſſe kinde of people, trecherous to thoſe they deale withall, diſdainfull, arrogant, ambitious, and worthy to be extermined out of the vtmoſt bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the worlde. Beſides many other ſuch goodly epethites, with which hee beautifies them in their colours, his whole booke being nothing elſe but railing agaynſt Engliſh papiſtes, wiſhing all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, noble men and Gentlemen whatſoeuer, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and take heed of them: and that in ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, vehement, and inuectiue manner, that it is not poſsible to be more.</p>
                  <p>But ſome man perchance may demaund of me what their meaning heerein may bee, or what credite, commoditie or gaine might haue allured them to enter into theſe before ſayd, ſo wicked and deteſtable imaginations.</p>
                  <p>For aunſweare heereunto: firſt I tolde you, that ſo they might bee accounted and reputed for greate ſtate-men, high ſpirited, and greate of action, to procure that reputation and eſtimation they care not whoſe eſtate they indaunger. But beſides all this which wee haue alreadie ſpoken of, they haue alſo further meaninges and driftes, as thoſe that doe looke deepelyeſt and diligenteſt into theyr actions, doe verilye imagine, and haue bene by ſundrie their proceedinges euidently
<pb facs="tcp:8993:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>diſcouered, amongeſt which the chiefeſt is, that as they are of all people liuing the moſt ambitious, ſo ſeeing this beggarly ſeruice doeth not fit their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, they doe feed themſelues with an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time to come, I meane a Spaniſh or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh world in this our countrie, at which time then they doubt not, the long time of their exile, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and lacke of liuing conſidered (for ſo is theyr phraſe and manner of ſpeech) to become mightie and great men, and to haue the principal rule, ſway dignity, and great authoritie in our countrie. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againe on the other ſide, conſidering that they are but baſe companions of births and liuing, and that there are in England many gentlemen of great qualitie and houſes of the ſame religion, that wold diſdaine to haue ſuch mates preferred before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in race, quality or degree: they haue gon (by all means poſsible they can) about by practiſe or colourable deuiſes to roote them out, ſo ſeruing their turnes two waies: the one to winne reputation of men of ſeruice: the other, to rid themſelues of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitours. But (God be thanked) the chiefeſt harme their conſpiracies haue done hitherto, hath ben to themſelues, and they confounded in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes. And yet for all this, ſo many tragicall endes of their ſo many traiterous proceedinges, are they not moued with any ſparke of repentaunce. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the ruine of ſo many of you their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-men wrought and contriued by their practiſe, allurement and perſwaſion, bred in them anie fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of remorſe of conſcience, but rather are therby
<pb facs="tcp:8993:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>animated &amp; incouraged to ſet new deuiſes abroch, with meaning in deed by ſowing ſeditions among you, &amp; by oppoſing you againſt the ſtate, to make you the onely inſtruments of the others ruine, and ſo to make the way open to the Spaniſh tyrant, to which end there is no weeke but they receyue ſpies and ſpials from you. Inſomuch that (I ſpeake vpon good aſſuraunce) there are at this inſtant among you aboue three hundred ſeditious beggerlye prieſts, ſent ouer by them to no other purpoſe. A little before the comming of the Spaniſh fleet, they ſent foure prieſts, and two Ieſuites, in diſguiſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, throughly inſtructed to ſound the meaning of ſuch Gentlemen, as they thought to be of theyr religion, and to incline their minds to the Spaniſh cauſe, encouraging them to take Armes againſt her MAIESTY, to which end they printed in Engliſh many hundred of bookes in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> barrelling them vp vntill ſuch time as the Army ſhould haue bene landed, and then their meaning was to haue diſperſed them, full of the moſt blaſphemous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and proud traiterous menaces, as well agaynſt her Maieſtie, as againſt you all in generall, as neuer (I thinke) the like was heard of.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, they haue obtained of the Pope, &amp; of the king, that as many as had their voices in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe, at ſuch time as the Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was adiudged to die, of what degree ſo euer they were, ſhould be depriued not onely of theyr liues and liuings, but that their poſterity alſo ſhuld be for euer diſ-inherited and diſanulled. The like
<pb facs="tcp:8993:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo they threatned in their bookes to all ſuch, as well noble men as others, that ſhould after the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Spaniards armie, perſiſt in arms againſt the ſame. But all this by the goodnes of God hath but ſerued to diſcouer their wicked intentions, and to animate al true Chriſtian Engliſhmen, to perſiſt with the greater loue, vnitie and courage in their obedience to her Maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>But returning againe my ſpeeches to you, (O vnnaturall Engliſh-men) to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhould obey trecherous and vnfaithfull, and of thoſe that you doe obey contemned and made ſlaues! how can you indure to thirſt after the deſtruction of ſo ſweete a countrie, in which you receiued your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; that gaue you nuriture being yong? VVhat religion muſt that bee, that animateth you to ſeeke ſubuerſion of ſo benigne a princeſſe and of ſo glorious an eſtate? The olde worthie Romans thought it the moſt heroycall thing that might bee, to vowe themſelues ſometimes to death for their countrie, and euen to ſpend their liues in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their altars, temples and monumentes of their Elders: and you ſeeke to ſee your Countrie bathing in the bloud of your parents, kindred, and friendes, to ſee your cities, temples, and auncient monuments flaming in the fire, to ſee your virgins defloured, and further, to bring the nobleſt nations to perpetuall ſlauerie and ſeruitude, yea, and that of the moſt baſe, wicked, proude and cruelleſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that liueth, a nation not yet fully an hundred yeeres ſince wholie they receiued Chriſtianitie,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>and as yet are in their heartes a great number of them, Pagans and Moores, from profeſsion of which, they are onely held by the ſeuere bridle of the ſanguinary and moſt cruell heathen Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>But that Paganiſme of theirs, which in theyr profeſsion they dare not ſhew, they do in their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, blaſphemy, ſodomy, cruelty, murther, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and other abominations ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. If the <hi>Nunamantines Saquntines,</hi> and <hi>Neſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiagis</hi> burned their townes, ſlew their wiues and children, and families themſelues, rather than they would receyue the yoke of worthy and vertuous Nations that inuaded them. VVhat ſhould wee then do, whome our vertuous aunceſtours haue left honoured with the innumerable trophies of many victories, rather than to indure the inſolent, wicked, and tyrannous gouernment of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whome all Europe hath in horrour, leauing to our poſterity after vs a perpetuall ſeruitude and bondage, and an euerlaſting memory of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
                  <p>But leauing this vntill a fitter time, I hope this that is alreadye ſayde ſhall bee ſufficient to make you clearely and plainely vnderſtand, that there is not to bee obtayned the ſweetneſſe, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and tranquility of conſcience which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and looke for, but rather, turmoyle and griefe of minde, wyth a perpetuall grudging and remorſe of conſcience, ſcandalized wyth infinite and innumerable examples of euill life, impietie,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſodomye, blaſphemye, defamation, and periurie. On the other ſide, towardes her Maieſtye and the ſtate of your country, you ſhall be helde &amp; reputed as a traitor, and of thoſe whom you ſhal here ſerue, no better, who make no further reckning of any of vs, than as of baſe people, fugitiues out of our cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for debt, theeuery, of ſome other hainous crime or other, thinking it a matter vnpoſsible (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we diſguiſe the ſame vnder pretext of religion) that any man beeing in his country of honeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or meanes to liue, ſhould be ſo ſenſeleſſe as to exchange the ſame for a condition ſo baſe, begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and infamous, as that which wee doe heere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: And ſo did a Spaniſh Captaine in playne tearms ſignifie to ſir <hi>William Standley,</hi> as they paſſed in the ordinary boote betweene <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now to the third point of my Diſcourſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the miſlike which ſundry of you haue of her Maieſties gouernement, and the ſtate of your countrie at this preſent, to ſeeke to tranſporte your ſelues hether as into a hauen of bliſſe &amp; ſecurity. I will by comparing the one with the other, as neere as I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let you ſee the difference between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, and ſo conſequently, your errour, as neere as I can geſſe, &amp; by report of ſundry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thence infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, this your diſliking proceedeth of two points: The one, that your lawes are too rigorouſly &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely executed againſt ſuch as profeſſe the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion: The other, that the aduerſarie hath buzzed a feare into your heades, making you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb facs="tcp:8993:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the fortes of your ſtate are too feeble to reſiſt ſo mightye and puiſant an enemye as the Spaniſh king, whoſe mighty treaſures, many domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, &amp; armies of men they magnifie to the skies, and therefore perchaunce you couet to ioyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with the partie which you doe thinke moſt aduantagious for your future ſecurity &amp; aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, touching the perſecutions of Catholikes, which our traytours here ſo much exclaime vpon, filling whole volumes therewith, &amp; aggreuating the ſame in tearmes moſt bitter and lamentable to foraine Nations. Let vs ſee what reaſon they haue. I would fayne demande one queſtion, If euer they did reade, heare, or knowe of anye one King or Queene, that did with greater mildeneſſe of lenity tollerate or ſuffer within his or her dominion a ſect of religion oppoſite to the lawes by him or her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablyſhed, eſpeciallye the ſame hauing ſundrye times rebelliouſly attempted againſt their crowne, ſtate, and dignity.</p>
                  <p>Let them looke (if there be men of iudgement) into the ages paſſed, euen amongſt the Heathen, and into the preſent time among all the Princes of Europe, and if there bee not any to be founde that hath dealt with the like lenity as her Maieſty hath done, why then doe they ſo falſely ſlaunder her? Doe they not know that ſhee is the ſacred and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Queene appoynted by God to gouerne them? If they doe, why doe they not then with all penitencye and humility, loue, honor, and obey
<pb facs="tcp:8993:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>her, and praying to God to conuert her (ſeeing ſuch is their deſire) and not by traiterous miſchiefe ſeek to murther and depriue her. They learned not that of the ancient Chriſtians in the primitiue church. But they will ſay, ſhe hath executed many ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prieſts: I confeſſe ſhe hath indeede by cutting them off preſerued her realme from many diſeaſes that rankled within the ſame. But yet hath ſhee proceeded therein in ſo gracious and mercifull a ſort, that ſhee hath witneſſed ſufficiently vnto the worlde, howe loath ſhee is to come vnto bloud, ſo long as there is any other remedy in the worlde to bee vſed. For her Maieſty knoweth, her councell knoweth, you and I, and the whole world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the comming of theſe Seminaries, prieſts, and Ieſuites, to reconcile men, as they tearme it, to the obedience of the Roman Church, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obſtinately to alienate and diuert theyr mindes from her Maieſty, and to encline them to bee ready to aſsiſt any enemy eyther within or without the realme, that ſhall colour his cauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of religion. Her Maieſty, I ſay, and Councell, and all good ſubiects knowing this, and foreſeeing the danger that might thereof inſue, forbade by Acte of Parliament theſe ſeminaries to enter into her realme, or to vſe or exerciſe anye ſuch ſeditious doctrine, limiting therwithal a time to ſuch as were within the realme, to depart out of the ſame. But this ſufficed not, theſe good fellowes thinke no lawes good or to be obeyed, but ſuch as they make themſelues.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8993:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>In they came as faſt as before, greate numbers of them were taken &amp; impriſoned, who though her Maieſtie deſeruedly and with great iuſtice, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the daylye miſciefe ſtirred vp within the Realme by their ſeditious practiſes conſidered) might haue executed as traitours and rebelles, yet the greatneſſe of her princely clemencie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion was ſo loth to come vnto bloud, that ſhee cauſed them all once more to be pardoned, and to bee put out of the Realme, but with expreſſe commaundement neuer to returne in like ſort: in dooing otherwiſe they ſhould bee ſure to finde no fauour. All this would not ſerue their turnes, but in diſpight of her Maieſtie and contempt of her lawes, ſundrie of them returned, of which ſome of them being taken, haue receiued the hire of theyr graceleſſe diſobedience and rebellous attempt.</p>
                  <p>But that her Maieſtie ſecketh not bloud, as they moſt falſely gaue out, appeareth by her clemencie vſed to ſundrie of them, taken by her ſouldiers in the Low Countries, who though they were of ſir <hi>William Standley</hi> his crewe and adherents, her moſt profeſſed enemies, yet ſeeing they were not taken within England, ſhee graciouſly pardoned them, and cauſed to be ſet at libertie, in giuing ſome litle recompence to thoſe ſouldiers that had taken them priſoners, VVhere is then her rigor you ſpeake of? I hope the king of Spaine keepeth another maner of rule in his Countries, ouer all <hi>Spaine, Portugall, Lombardie, Naples,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ciciliae,</hi> whoſoeuer ſpeaketh a word, or makes the leſt ſigh in the world to diſlike
<pb facs="tcp:8993:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>his religion there eſtabliſhed, or any one poynt or ceremonie thereof, his cruell miniſters the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, cauſe without remiſsion to be burnt aliue: as for example, There was this laſt yeere a Citizen in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> one <hi>Gyles Rat</hi> a ſhoomaker, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Spaine</hi> about ſome buſines, was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſmiling at the Image of our Lady, brought before the Inquiſitours, and by them preſentlye condemned to fire, and with him an Engliſh-man for the lyke cauſe: whoſe name the Gentleman that ſawe them burned knewe not: but hee tolde mee that at the time of their execution, there mounted on a ſcaffolde thereby two Ieſuites, forbidding the people vpon paine of Excommunication to praie for them, ſaying that they had deliuered them both ouer in bodie and ſoule to the deuill, as thoſe that died obſtinate and wilfull heretikes. I would faine knowe how hee would doe with Miniſters, if hee ſhoulde catch them in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as the Queene hath done prieſts in England. As for his Lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I neuer heard but of two taken, and that was at the ſiege of <hi>Dermond,</hi> and they were both put in to ſackes by the Spaniards, and throwne into the riuer.</p>
                  <p>This is indeede Tyrannie, and not that which her Maieſtie doth, who is alwaies readie to receiue into grace and fauour thoſe of whome ſhee hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope that they will become good ſubiects, and hath (as I haue heard) offered euen at the houre of their death her princely mercy and fauour to ſome of them, if they woulde haue promiſed to become
<pb facs="tcp:8993:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>good ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>Oh how different from this is their proceeding heere which you ſee ſo highly commended! But it is the nature of men, eſpecially of thoſe, whoſe iudgements are not ſetled as they ſhoulde bee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to miſlike and loath thoſe thinges to which they are accuſtomed, thinking other to them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known far better. If you did but once ſee the tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vſage &amp; explication what is vſed in matter of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the poore people vnder the Spaniſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in this Countrie, I doubt not but you would be of another opinion, eſpecially the woful ſlauerie conſidered in which the cleargie, or rather the rauening multitude of Ieſuites, Friers, Monks and prieſts doe keepe their minde ſubiected. It is not ſufficient that they hold their mindes in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall deſpaire, pronouncing vppon euerie friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous point damnation vnto them: but withal, they compell them perforce to offerings, to buying of pardons and indulgences, to giue them money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the reparation of their Churches, pictures, images, and waxe candles, alwaies hauing one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice or other in hand to robbe them, and to drawe from them their ſubſtance: for whoſoeuer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to euery of theſe demaunds, is preſently an heretike.</p>
                  <p>The beſt houſes in the Towne they take vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently from the true owners, and appropriate vnto themſelues, ſaying it is meete that God ſhould firſt be ſerued before man. There is no one daie but the poore citizens are puniſhed and peſtered with one
<pb facs="tcp:8993:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>or other of their orders of Friers, Monkes, Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, Capuchines, Candles, and monie towardes the reparation of their Churches, and which they muſt not be denied, vnleſſe you will bee preſently accuſed for an heretike.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt is, to ſee how buſie and diligent they are when they heare of a wealthie man that lyeth ſick, and is in danger of death. This is their chiefeſt harueſt and moſt <hi>optima praeda:</hi> then they commend vnto him the pouertie of their cloiſter, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite that hee ſhould gaine, as beeing for euer to bee remembred in their maſſes, as one of theyr bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: the Ieſuits and Cordelleres are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in proceſſe of Spaine about this matter of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſicke men, <hi>in articulo mortis.</hi> The Ieſuites ſaie that it appertaines vnto them, becauſe theyr profeſsion is actiue, &amp; alwaies ſtirring among the flocke, and to doe good in the worlde abroade, whereas that of the Cordelleres is contemplatiue, and ſo by conſequence, moſt decent that they ſhoulde containe themſelues within theyr cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>The Cordelleres on the other ſide replye, that theyr profeſsion is meekeneſſe, innocencie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and to doe good vnto all men. As for the Ieſuites, that they are proude, ambitious, aſpiring, medlers in matters of ſtate, men of great riches, and couetous of more, and therefore by no meanes to bee admitted to ſuch as lye at the article of death. The matter hath beene much argued of, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debated in Spaine, and beſides, the Ieſuites haue
<pb facs="tcp:8993:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>openly inueighed againſt them in the publike ſchooles of <hi>Louaine:</hi> yet notwithſtanding how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the cry goeth againſt them, they holde theyr owne. But this by the way, ſeeing it comes ſo wel to our purpoſe, I cannot chuſe but tell you a prety ieaſt which happened this laſt Summer in theſe partes.</p>
                  <p>A Marchant of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Hamiel,</hi> being ſicke of a conſumption or feauer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thike, the Ieſuites knowing him to bee a man of great poſſeſſions, and without children, preſentlye repayred vnto him vnder colour of ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, laying before him the vanitie of this lyfe and the certainty of the worlde to come: wyth ſundry other perſwaſions, as of all men lyuing they haue their tongues moſt at will: withall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending vnto him their order, as of all other the moſt meritorious, perfect, and acceptable to God, and to which our holye father the Pope and his predeceſſors haue granted more indulgences than to any other order whatſoeuer: they brought the poore man, being of himſelfe ſimple, into their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, thinking that there was no other way to bee ſaued, and withall before hand infeoffed their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege with his land, which was two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred pound a yeere, giuing them beſides, much goods and riche moueables, and when he had ſo done, died within three moneths after the ſame: his next heires, by counſell of their friends, put the Ieſuites in ſuite, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt which, though they oppoſed themſelues with all vehemencie, yet to theyr great ſhame and
<pb facs="tcp:8993:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>reprehenſion, ſentence was giuen agaynſt them. Notwithſtanding they would not give ouer, but by the meanes, aid, and ſupport of preſident <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> who is one of theyr beſt children, they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from thence to the councell of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> getting the cauſe after ſentence giuen to bee remooued, a thing vnuſuall or ſcarcely euer heard off before, as yet there the proceſſe hangeth, by hooke or by crooke it is thought they will haue it in the ende. Another time a riche and wealthy Merchaunt of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> but one in that point whoſe deuotion &amp; ſcrupulocity ouer-went his wiſdome, comming to them in confeſsion, and telling them of ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt gaine with which he felt his conſcience touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſuddenly with ſundry terrifiyng ſpeeches, tolde him that hee was in the ſtate of damnation, out of which he could not bee delyuered, vntyll ſuch time as hee had made reſtitution as well of that confeſſed, as of all other mony and goods that hee had by vſury vnlawfully gotten, laying before him, <hi>Quod none dimittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur oblatum:</hi> with ſundry other ſuch ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, of which they had ſtore: in fine, they put the poore man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch feare of conſcience, that he yelded to make reſtitution, if ſo the ſane might bee done without his vndoing, dyſcredite, or ſhame. VVhereupon to comfort him agayne, but in deede fearing leaſt that if they dealt too rigorouſly with him they ſhould get nothing, they tolde him, that if in ſteade of all ſuch intereſt and iniuryes, with which hee felt his conſcience burdened, hee would onely be content
<pb facs="tcp:8993:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>to deliuer vnto them ſome ſuch ſumme of monie, as without his vndooing, he thought conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might ſpare, they woulde take it vppon their ſoules to ſee the ſaid ſumme imploied upon good, vertuous, and charitable vſes, to the greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and merite of his ſoule, and as a thing more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and leſſe ſcandelous to the world than if he ſhould make reſtitution to whome it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, and that were by that his vſurie intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. VVhereupon the Marchant beeing well ſatiſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſcience, gaue them the monie, and they him their abſolution.</p>
                  <p>But I will hold you no longer with the recitall of theſe things, of which if I would entreate, their impiety would yeelde me too much matter. My principall meaning and intention onely beeing to let you ſee, that vnder heauen there is no ſtate ſo wickedly, impiouſly, &amp; deuouringly gouerned in matter of religion and conſcience, as theſe here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spaniard. I thinke the recital of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would rather breede in you admiration than beleefe, ſo far doth the ſame exceede the compaſſe of al their tyrannies that euer were vſed, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no calamity in the world of which they haue not taſted of. Their noblemen &amp; rulers, in whoſe vertue and courage conſiſted their chiefeſt refuge in times paſt, when they were wronged &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixed, haue beene murdered, ſtrangled, poiſoned, and ſlayne by the bloudy miniſters of their cruell king: they are taxed in great ſummes, and numbers of men ſent violently into France &amp; forrein wars,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the relikes of their nobility forced to go with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in perſon, to their apparant ſlaughter, leauing in the meane time their countries in pray to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, their villages flaming in fire, &amp; their towns battered about their eares wyth the canon, their priuiledges are by wrong and tyranny taken from them, their cities that ſometimes ſtriued with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency and glorie with the goodlieſt and greateſt of the world, are gouerned by baſe and barbarous Spaniardes, brideled with their garriſons and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels, and forraged &amp; ſpoyled by them, at ſuch time as their payment faileth. No face of iuſtice in their common-wealth, but the ſame is pliable to the wil of ſuch ſtrangers as are gouernors of their towns, &amp; captains of their caſtles, their goodly hauens, harboring ſometimes with innumerable ſhips la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with marchandiſe from all parts of the world, are now frequented euen of the fiſher-boates, their trafficke ceaſed, and their townes almoſt deſarte: in the moſt of which, of tenne houſes together, there are ſcarſe three inhabited, their villages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade burned and ouergrowen with buſhes, their goodly meddowes and fruitfull paſtures drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many miles wide and long, by letting in of ſluces, and cutting downe ditches. The manſion houſes and caſtels of their Nobilitie abuſed and throwen downe, the errable ground waſte and vntilled, inſomuch that there a man may haue as much land as hee will, and thankes withall, for the onely manuring thereof. As for the poore labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people of the country, for the moſt part they
<pb facs="tcp:8993:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>are all ſtarued and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed with hunger, of which diſeaſe, I my ſelfe haue knowne two thouſand die in one ſummer, ſo that you may ride in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an hundred miles without ſeeing of a man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or childe, vnleſſe it bee ſome poore ſillie ſoule that commeth creeping out of the woodes hunger ſtarued, more like confuſitated ghoſtes, than a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing chriſtian creature. And yet all theſe in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner happier, becauſe they are at an ende of theyr miſeries, than ſuch as doe liue within the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places of the countrie, as Cempine and the land of VVaſt: and theſe of all the people in the world I take to be the moſt wretchedſt. Ouer euery village of theſe are appoynted certaine horſmen, to whom they are all to pay monethly contribution, ſome ten pounds, ſome twentie, and ſome thirtie, ſome more and ſome leſſe, I knew one village that paide an hundred poundes euery moneth, called <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolt:</hi> but they payde it ſo long, till all the dwellers ranne away, and haue now in a manner left it void of inhabitauntes. Ouer this village and the whole Countrie is appoynted a Commiſſarie called <hi>Sygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> for the payment of theyr contributions, of all tyrants liuing the moſt cruelleſt, and of leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. VVho if they faile, and doe not bring in theyr money at the laſt day of the moneth, hee ſendes forth troupes of horſe-men to take the beſt of them priſoners, and withall, to driue home to their quarters or garriſons ſuch ſheepe, oxen, or cattell whatſoeuer as they finde in thoſe villages, which hee cauſeth, if the money followe not
<pb facs="tcp:8993:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>within fiue or ſixe daies at the furtheſt, to be ſold at the drum or Trumpet, and withal, forceth them to pay a great fine, the one halfe of which hee retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to himſelfe, and the other to the ſouldiers, for their out-roads and forbearance of the money. But the miſerie of theſe poore people endeth not here, for beſides all this, they are forced many times to lodge ſoldiers in their houſes, as they march along the countrie vpon ſeruice, at which time it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible what outrages they receyue, their cattell kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, their corne threſhed out and giuen to horſe, their cheſts broken vp, their goods eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the verie ſheetes and tikes of beds, ſtollen and carried away by the ſoldiers when they march, themſelues bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and their wiues and their daughters abuſed: and in fine, what elſe is to the nature of man grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and intollerable, they are conſtrained to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Neither is the condition of the poore citizens or towns-men any better, who being forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue garriſon, and to lodge ſouldiers in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, imparting to them the beſt chambers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the ſame, neuer hearing from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other worde, eſpecially if they pleaſe not them in all their exhorbitant demand,, than <hi>Perhamengo, Lutherano, Borchio,</hi> &amp;c. Yet, beſides, they are daylye wearied out with continuall exactions and taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the hundred pennie, the tenth pennie, and once a yeere without faile, the fiftly pennie of all their goods and landes, beſides infinite other pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and gatherings towardes the making of ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, bulwarkes, ballaſadowes, countercerpes, and
<pb facs="tcp:8993:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>the reparation of their wals, and to giuing of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, bread, beere, and cheeſe, to ſuch ſouldiers as ſhall paſſe by their townes diſtreſſed of victualles, with infinit ſuch like. I haue knowen (I ſpeak it of my faith) poore people of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> forced to ſell their beddes they lie vppon, to ſatisfie their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous exactions, which if they ſhould not doe, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their goods, attachment of their perſons, ſhoulde preſently followe. But which is moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond reaſon, whereas within the townes the moſt part of their houſes are vacant and vnhired, yet the owners of them are taxed according to the value in which they were wont to bee hired. Inſomuch, that in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> &amp; other townes, it is a matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vſual for men to diſclaime, and quit their owne houſes, thereby to be exempted of ſuch paiment as otherwiſe by reaſon of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are charged with, &amp; that they do iuriſdicially before the magiſtrate, at which time the <hi>Ainan</hi> entereth in, and ceaizeth vpon them to the kings vſe. Beſides, when as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Gentlemen and other the inhabitants of this countrie, hauing certaine annuall rents iſſuing out and charged vpon the kings demaines in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> at leaſt to the yeerely value of ten thouſand poundes, ſome of the which rents haue bene by themſelues bought of the ſtates generall, ſome left vnto them by their parents and predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. The king vniuſtly and by tyrannie diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſaid rents, hath, &amp; doth, without forme of iuſtice, take into his owne hands the ſaid demains, appropriating the vſe, commoditie, and reuenue
<pb facs="tcp:8993:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereof to the maintenance of the troupes of horſe men. But what ſhall I trouble you any longer with recounting vnto you the aſsiſe, impoſitions, taxes, extortions, pillages, and heauie intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens laid vpon this afflicted poor people, by their vniuſt and cruell king. Compare now (I pray you) heerewith, your eſtate of gouernment at home, and tell me which of them two you thinke to bee moſt fortunate. Doth her MAIESTY deale in this order with you, whoſe gouernment you ſo much miſlike? Oh God, how can you be ſo peruerſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſedneſſe wherein ſhee maintaines you, as not to acknowledge the ſame? How gentle are the helpes and ſubſidies which ſhe exacteth of you, without the vndooing or hinderance of any man of whom they are exacted? And on the other ſide, how profuſely ſpendeth ſhee her owne treaſure for the maintenance of your wiues, and children, and parents, in repoſe iuſtice and ſecuritie. Oh pray to God for her long life and proſperous eſtate, for in her conſiſteth the tipe of your felicitie!</p>
                  <p>But nowe to the other point of your miſlike. VVhereas the aduerſarie hath beaten into your heads, that the ſtate ſtandes daungerous, as beeing farre too feeble and not ſufficient to withſtand and reſiſt ſo mightie and oppoſite an enemie as is the king of Spaine, terrifying with millions of gold &amp; innumerable nations ouer whome hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, I hope by the cleer and euident reaſons I ſhal ſhew you, to make you vnderſtand that the fame of him is farre greater than his force, and that there is
<pb facs="tcp:8993:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>no prince this day in the world whoſe eſtate ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more tickle and ready to ruine than his, and that there is no cauſe why we ſhould fear him, but many why he ſhould feare vs. Firſt, that hee is the moſt mighty and oppulent prince of Europe, I do not deny, if hee had vſed moderation in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and acknowledged the benefites which God hath beſtowed vpon him with thankfulneſſe. But ſuch is the ſtate whereunto his ambitious aſpiring hath at this preſent brought him, or rather the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull hand of God which hangeth ouer his head for his horrible, tyrannies and odious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially for his wicked pariacide and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed vppon the perſon of his wife, his ſonne, and ſundry others of his beſt and trueſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: that he is in the midſt of theſe his riches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, poore, and indebted, vnable to giue ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſuch ſouldiers as he maintaineth, to which end he is forced to extort vpon his poore ſubiects, and tyrannize ouer them. Of this his indigency &amp; beggery, wee ſee euery day experience here before our eyes, his owne natural ſubiects, the Spaniards, being the beſt diſciplined ſouldiers he hath, and of whom he maketh greateſt account, are forced for want of their paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is now three yeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to ceaſe his towns and artillary, to contemne his commandements and proclamations, &amp; finally to bend their armes &amp; diſplay their Enſignes vpon the wals againſt the Duke. To remedie which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie, there was poſt vpon poſt ſent into Spain, yet in ſeuen moneths there could no monie be found.
<pb facs="tcp:8993:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>Notwithſtanding many &amp; moſt important detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he receyued by occaſion of this mutiny, as the loſſe of <hi>Breda,</hi> the retardaunce of the French ſuccours, the danger of <hi>Numigen, &amp;c.</hi> whereas the whole ſumme they demaunded was not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fifteen thouſand. Beſides, do but looke into the maner of his proceedings in theſe lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with his ſouldiers, (of which becauſe I haue beſt experience I will chiefly ſpeake) and you ſhall find nothing in the world more beggarly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent. Neither (as I heare) is it better in his other prouinces, which verily I beleeue, ſeeing of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it importeth him to vſe them beſt, as being his eldeſt, perfecteſt in diſcipline, &amp; beſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced troupes, and in fine, thoſe vnto whom he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt repoſeth, as the onely vpholders and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of him in his tyranny. Yet was there neuer in the world, I dare vndertake, King nor Prince, how bankerout, or needy ſoeuer, in whoſe ſeruice ſo many braue ſouldiers haue died of hunger, or that haue vſed ſuch cooſning trickes and ſnifts to ſtoppe neceſsities, and to deceiue his ſouldies as he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the countrey not being yet fully conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, waſted, and deſtroyed, he authorized his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſpoyle and ſteale the goodes and cattell of the poore peſants, forcing them to raunſome theyr houſes from fire, and their perſons from murther, by which meanes the ſouldiers lingered in ſuch ſort, that I haue knowen them remaine three yeres together with out one months pay. But afterward
<pb facs="tcp:8993:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> being rendered, &amp; by reaſon of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deuaſtation of the countrie, the ſouldiers fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to finde their wonted reliefe and praie, grewe into ſo great and miſerable extremitie, that it was a great matter to finde twentie ſouldiers vnder any Enſigne. The Spaniards mutined vpon the <hi>Staun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> whome they found meanes to appeaſe wyth ſome few months paiment. The VVallounds mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined in <hi>Laiskine, Houlke,</hi> and the land of the <hi>Waſt,</hi> the Almaines went by hundreds begging vp and downe the ſtreets of <hi>Antwerp</hi> bare legged, and bare footed, or in manner naked, the Italians ſtarued in their quarters, and diuers of them being in gariſon in <hi>Breda,</hi> ran thence to <hi>Huiſden,</hi> and to other towns of the enemy. To remedy all which inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he found meanes to deale with the Italian Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Antwarp for cloth and ſilke, as Northerne kerſies, packe-clothes, baies, refuſe Italian ſilkes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the ſame vpon exceſsiue intereſt yerely to a certayne ſumme: for receit of which, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out agayne, hee appoynted a Spaniard, one <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Craeſa,</hi> a man of moſt wicked conſcience, to be his treaſurer. Then he began to grant payments to the whole campe, horſe and foote, &amp; vnto ſuch gentlemen and penſioners as were in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, &amp; had bin long ſutors: which they hauing receiued, were forced for want of mony preſently to make ſale thereof for the third of that value in which they receiued it: ſo that a ſouldier hauyng foureteene ſhillings a moneths pay, receiued onely
<pb facs="tcp:8993:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>foure ſhillings and ſixe pence. And he hath his fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and brokers abroad to buy thoſe ſayd clothes and ſilkes again, which he deliuereth preſently out of the firſt price to the next that comes, and ſo ſtill forth deliuering and buying the ſame againe for the third part of the price, inſomuch that with an hundred pounds he maketh ten thouſand poundes in a yeere, and yet ſometimes he maketh them ſtay foure or fiue moneths before he will deliuer them cloth, or any contentment at all. And ſometimes hee neuer troubleth himſelfe with the deliuery of the cloth, but cauſeth their aſsignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be boght, as now at this inſtant ſir <hi>William Standly</hi> before his departure had obtained a <hi>Liberanca</hi> for two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths for his regiment, amounting to an hundred and fifty pounds, the payment thereof, hath beene deferred till this preſent, and is now ſolde in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe</hi> to one of his factors for three ſcore poundes, and yet hee that ſolde it made a good bargaine. I haue knowen diuers that haue ſolde diuers ſuch <hi>Liberancas</hi> for thirty pounds, and eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds in the hundred. Yet this payment how bad ſoeuer, hath ſomewhat contented the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers foure or fiue yeeres, rather hauing that than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But now alſo the ſame is dryed vp and come to nothing. Payments haue beene this halfe yeere very ſcarſe, and with much difficulty, for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants haue at this inſtant vtterly refuſed to furniſh him with any more wates, both becauſe the ſame wherein he ſtandeth already indebted vnto them
<pb facs="tcp:8993:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>amounteth to an exceſsiue matter, as alſo he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to wrangle with them, aboute the intereſt of which he craueth moderation: ſeeing beſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eies ſo many preſidents of men ruined, vndone, and diſhonored, ſuch as he hath delt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of which, what more apparaunt example maye there be than that of <hi>S. Siueres</hi> a Portugal marchant and one of the chiefeſt &amp; beſt reſpected marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> both for the wealth and credit which he poſſeſſed, as alſo for the ſecuritie and vprightneſſe which he handled: the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> reducted of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> the paſſage of the riuer ſhut vp, and the countries and townes afflicted with great dearth &amp; ſcarcity of corn, at which time rie was at 44. s. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the virendel in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> &amp; withal being dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried vpon by the generall of <hi>Vibres</hi> for muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; corn to victual the camp, the old ſtore being cleane conſumed: knewe no other meanes than to deale earneſtly with this <hi>S. Siueres,</hi> and other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that had trade with <hi>Hanborough, Lubeck,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſterlings,</hi> which countries were repleniſhed with corn, to make ſome aduenture thether for the releefe of the countrie: he amongſt the reſt ſhewed not himſelfe vnwilling to enter into an action ſo charitable and vertuous, if ſo be his pains might be requited, and hee ſufficiently warranted and kept free from ſuch danger as might inſue, either by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of ſea, taking of the enimies, or loſſe in the ſame: when it came to this end, the duke ſent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and procured him the kings Letters of aſſurance in
<pb facs="tcp:8993:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>the moſt ample manner poſsible, incouraging him with much thankes &amp; many promiſes to proceed, which hee did with the aduenture of moſt part of his credite and goods, inſomuch, that hee laded three ſhippes of which one was ſcattered by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and caſt away vpon the coaſt of Scotlande, the other two came ſafelie home to <hi>Callice,</hi> but at that time ſuch was either the il luck of him, or the good lucke of the countrey, that vpon a new plentie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt which they had, corne was abated from fortie foure ſhillinges the Virendell, to ſixe ſhillinges, at which price the Duke, by the kings appointment, bought his prouiſion and munition, vtterlye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that of <hi>Syueres,</hi> ſo that he was faine, whileſt he made his ſute to the king, to keepe the ſame ſo long vpon his owne hands, that it venowed and waxed muſtie, in ſome ſort, that he was faine to throw the greateſt part away, without euer to this day bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to receyue of the king one penny of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, inſomuch that hee was forced, to the wonderfull griefe, ſhame and confuſion of him, his wife, his children, and friends, hauing before time liued in the greateſt honour and magnificence of any Marchant in the Towne, to breake banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rout, and is at this preſent ſuing to the Duke, and the priuie Councell at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for a protection to keepe his bodie from attachment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the rewardes and recompence that this mightie Monarch giueth to thoſe that imploy their indeuours in his ſeruice. Of which if you doe
<pb facs="tcp:8993:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſire to haue better experience, looke but into the office of his treaſurer at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and there you ſhall dayly and hourely ſee a token ſufficient of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulencie and great magnificencie, there ſhall you finde a miſerable troupe of ſutours, with aſsignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for monie, graunted them by the Duke, ſome of which haue loſt a legge or an arme, eyther tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough age or infirmitie, that hath gotten their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Paſport to depart into their Countries, ſome pretending one cauſe and ſome another, but no one man able in two yeres folowing to get one pennie: ſo that there is no yeere but a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them die in the purſuite for hunger, yea, and ſome of them euen at his gates. Of my ſaluation I ſpeake it, I haue knowen ſome poore people, that for the ſumme of ſixe poundes haue followed him three yeeres: when eyther hee goeth out, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into his houſe, hee is faine to go thorough gardens and by-wayes, to deceyue his poore ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who otherwiſe aſſayed him, though in vaine, with ſuch ruthfull cryes, that it would pearſe anie mans heart to heare them. VVhich beggerlineſſe, and miſerie, ſundrie worthie ſouldiers of ſtraunge nations ſeeing, eſpecially the baſe and vnworthie vſage which they themſelues receiued, haue aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that banquerout ſeruice, as <hi>Iohn Baptiſta de Monte,</hi> and <hi>Camillo de Monte,</hi> two warlike Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, but now retained vnder two mightie ſtates, the one Generall to the Duke of Florence, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Venetians, who both lie in waite to cry
<pb facs="tcp:8993:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>quittance with him, and by Gods grace ſhall one day haue meanes to accompliſh their deſire. Then ſir <hi>Martine Skinke,</hi> of whoſe iuſt diſcontentment and valerous reuenge, you your ſelues in England are witnes. VVhere are then the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the mightie king poſſeſſeth? Or if yee ſay he ſpareth them to ſome other end, I pray you tell me to what, &amp; when he will vſe them? If not now the danger of the loſſe of his countrie, fame, &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the greatneſſe of the cauſes hee hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and conſidered. No, no, it is pure want &amp; extreame indigences that forceth him to deale ſo, though he be rich, yet the greatneſſe of the cauſe he is entered into, doth farte exceede the meanes hee hath to maintaine the ſame. Vppon the comming downe of this laſt fleete hee ſet vp his reſt, and loſt it, not onely his owne, but that alſo of his friendes, the pope, the duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the <hi>Geneoiſes,</hi> &amp;c. which ſet him into ſuch arrerages, that I thinke hee will not eaſily come out of them.</p>
                  <p>As for the treaſure of his Indians, where in deede conſiſteth the verie marrowe, ſtrength, and ſubſtance of all his puiſſance, I confeſſe the ſame to bee great, yet his charges conſidered, making an eſtimate betweene the one and the other, it can no waie bee able to aunſwere and counteruayle them. And yet the ſame hath beene reaſonable well impaired alſo, ſince ſuch time as ſir <hi>Fraunces Drake</hi> and other of your worthy Engliſh captaines by ſea, haue begunne to firke him in thoſe. For
<pb facs="tcp:8993:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>whereas before hee was wont vſually to waite his Indian fleete home-warde with a Gallyaſſe or two, onely their returne accuſtomed to be euery ſixe moneths, hee is nowe forced to maintayne a great and mighty Nauy of many ſhippes and gallyes, to his ineſtimable and continuall charges. Notwithſtanding all which, his returne is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aboue once a yeere, and that oftentimes minglingly as may be, and yet they are ſometimes met withall, ſome of them ſcattered, ſome ſunke, and ſome of them alſo taken by our Engliſhe ſhippes.</p>
                  <p>If you will knowe what theſe his great charges are, on which hee is enforced to employ them. Firſt, conſider that he ſcarcely holdeth any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in which hee is not conſtrained to holde gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of ſouldiers. As for theſe lowe Countries, I knowe it vppon good and aſſured grounds, there hath beene no yeere theſe twenty yeeres, but they haue coſt him one with another two millions and more yeerely aboue the reuenue and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities receyued thereout, and yet howe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly his ſouldiers are vſed, you haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The reſt, for <hi>Naples, Cicilia, Portugall maiorque, minorque,</hi> the frontires of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and <hi>Lombardie:</hi> hee is faine to be at the charge of many ſtrong and mighty garriſons by lande, and in the moſt of them maine Gallyes or other ſhipping in the Hauens, and all along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>none of which he can for his life diminiſh, for his gouernment is ſo hateful, that none of theſe prouinces are his any longer than hee hath their heades in the bridle. And beſides, his prouinces ſtand ſo ſeuered and diſunited, that the tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his nauie from one to an other is infinite chargeable vnto him, inſomuch that I haue heard ſome of his commiſsioners here ſweare, that there is no crowne of his that commeth from Spaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Countries by land, but ſtandeth them in fiue rialles, ſo infinite is the charge of carriages, conuoyes and commiſſaries, to deliuer and receiue the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, he disburſeth yeerely mighty ſummes of mony to the Perſian, to the end to keep the Turke occupyed, of whom he ſtandeth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in feare: and truely he hath reaſon, if her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would condeſcend to ſuch conditions as haue beene by this Turke to her propoſed. But ſhee like a chriſtian Princeſſe, how greatly ſoeuer to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage the ſame might be, will not do any thing whereby chriſtianity might hereafter ſeerne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any detriment.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Polonia,</hi> the ſame hath beene incredible chargeable vnto him, aſwell for the mighty bribes beſtowed vpon the nobles of the country, as alſo the charges of a great army of <hi>Rewtiers:</hi> he ſent his kinſman <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> what by force and what by help of the part which he had gained, and with his treaſures, thought to inueſt him in the
<pb facs="tcp:8993:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>kingdome. The ſucceſſe of which enterpriſe I wold not write, being to the whole world notorious and knowen. In the conſiſtorie of Rome hee is faine to entertaine a great number of thoſe hungrie Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in penſion and fee, thereby to gain theyr voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when need requireth, which liberalitie of his he cannot by anie meanes withdrawe, for in ſo doing, he ſhould be aſſured to haue them his enemies, and contrarie to his proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for concluſion, hee maketh at this inſtant open warres with France, England, and the Lowe counties. What deeme you then heereof? Hath he not (trow you) vent for his treaſures? His father was a better ſouldier and a greater man of warre than he is, and as mightie a prince euerie deale (his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Indians onely excepted) in place of which he quietly inioyed theſe his Lowe countries, which in reſpect of theyr great oppulencie, abundance of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; conuenientnes of ſcituation, were to them accounted nothing inferior. And yet he neuer da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red attempt to make warres vpon France alone, but he firſt ſought by all poſsible meanes to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in friendſhip with England, giuing to that end great and mightie preſents to Cardinall <hi>Wolſey,</hi> and others of the councell, that in thoſe daies were with her Maieſties father of worthie memorie, K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight: whereas his ſonne makes war with all the world careleſly at once, but the Italians haue a true prouerbe, <hi>Cum tutto abraccianes iun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> string.</hi> And ſo I hope it ſhall fare with him.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching thoſe his mightie and puiſant
<pb facs="tcp:8993:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>numbers of men which they ſay he is able to make, I take vpon me to know the ſtate of his forces aſwell as other, and I herein of all other men know him to be moſt needie &amp; wanting. For as for Spaine, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Lombardie, of which his onely force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and which are his chiefeſt ſtore-houſes of men, it is ſufficiently knowen that his drums haue gone a whole yeere beating vp and downe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as theyr maner is, to get together ſix thouſand men, and thoſe all ſhepheardes, hedgebreakers, and ſuch idle trewantly rogues, the moſt part of which hee is forced to put in garriſon for a yeere or two to faſhion them, before hee ſend them to ſeruice. I ſaw about two yeeres agone a freſh leuie that came out of <hi>Paſtrauia,</hi> who put them preſently in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Antwarpe,</hi> drawing out the olde garriſon, the moſt ſilly naked ſnakes that euer I ſawe in my lyfe, ſuch, as in my conſcience, a man in deed would beat ten of them.</p>
                  <p>As for Germanie, out of the which heeretofore hee hath drawen greate numbers, and by theyr help done great matters before <hi>Maſtrig</hi> in <hi>Freiſland,</hi> and thoſe places, his vſage hath bene ſo baſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable vnto them, that the old ſouldiers are all ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and conſumed in his ſeruice, whoſe calamitie hath ſo terrfied the reſt at home, that no prince in Europe hath leſſe credite to raiſe men there than hee. And although there were no ſuch matter, yet they are no waie more bound vnto him than to an other, theyr profeſsion beeing to ſerue onely him beſt that will pay them beſt, and yet if hee ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:8993:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>raiſe anie of the allyaunces of her Maieſtie, and the ſcituation of their Countrie conſidered, it ſhoulde be a matter of great difficultie to ioyne them wyth his other troups. Where are then his innumerable legions, with which hee meanes to ouercome the world? Alliance hee hath none, vnleſſe it bee wyth the rebellious league of France: of them he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no aide nor comfort, themſelues being miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and diſtreſſed, by reaſon wherof, moſt burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vnto him, &amp; yet there is no man liuing in the world leſſe beholding vnto them than he. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his aſsiſtance, they woulde neuer yeeld to receiue his forces into their townes or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, ſeruing only their turnes on him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time.</p>
                  <p>As for the Pope and the Princes of Italy, what fayre weather ſo euer they do beare him, he neither truſteth them, nor they him, and great reaſon they haue ſo to do. And wythall, this malediction hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vppon him, that as hee is of all forraine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſtruſted, doubted, and abhorred, ſo both hee and the very name of a Spaniard is moſt loathſome and hatefull to the reſt of his owne ſubiects. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that in Millaine the young Gentlemen haue a paſtime by night, which they call <hi>Caccia Marran,</hi> that is, putting on a viſard on theyr face by night, they goe with theyr long Rapiers or picked Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes vnder their cloakes, out into the Towne to ſeeke Spaniardes in the ſtewes, or anie other place where they thinke they are lykely to finde anie of them: vnto whome they giue as manye ſtabbes
<pb facs="tcp:8993:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>and blowes that they can laie vpon them, inſomuch that the Spaniards dare not for their eares abide out of the caſtle after ſhutting in of the gates. As for his dealing in Portugall, who knowes not his cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, and the hatred they beare him?</p>
                  <p>But now come to her MAIESTIE, &amp; you ſhall find another manner of ſtate of matters, her realme plentifully abounding in men of warlike diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of whom ſhe is loued &amp; adored: her warres are iuſt, charitable, godly, &amp; defenſiue, for maintenance of which, beſides the truſt that ſhe repoſeth in God, who hath hetherto mightily and miraculouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her, ſhe is alied in ſtraight league, friendſhip &amp; confederation with the moſt victorious &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian king of France, with the kings of Denmarke &amp; Scotland, with the Switzers, and with ſundrie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtates of the Empire, al being her neighbors dominions vnited with hers, and thereby readie to aſsiſt, aid, &amp; ſuccor one another in all ſuch occaſions as ſhall or may happen. All this then conſidered, tell me, I praie you what occaſion of feare or miſdoubt you haue. If you thinke the Engliſh valor not to be compared with that of the Spaniard, reade but the Chronicles, and you ſhall finde how much you are deceiued: you ſhall finde that a ſmall armie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men, vnder the conduct of that worthie prince of Wales, eldeſt ſonne to Edward the third, paſſed in deſpight of them thorough <hi>Cauarre</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there in the middeſt and bowels of their owne countrie, ouerthrew at <hi>Nadres</hi> their vſurping king, <hi>Henry</hi> the baſtard (of whoſe race this man is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:8993:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>by his grandmother) being accompanied with the nobilitie of the countrie, and 60000. of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt fighting men in Spaine, &amp; ſo vtterly ouerthrew him, that they erected king in his place <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> their iuſt &amp; lawfull prince of that kingdome, whom by maine force they conſtrained all their cities and noble men of the countrie to receiue. Read beſides the valorous conqueſts atchieued by <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> brother vnto the ſayde prince, in <hi>Callicia,</hi> againſt <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> ſonne of the ſayd <hi>Henrie,</hi> the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping baſtard: beſides, the chronicles of Portugal are full of the materiall proweſſe of the Engliſh, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victories obtained in ſeruice of their king, to whoſe aide they were called againſt the ſayde king of <hi>Caſtilo.</hi>

                  <p>But what neede I run backe into the paſſed ages to ſeeke examples? Looke but into the incounters that haue bene of late daies betweene them and vs, either by ſea or lande, and you ſhall finde that they haue alwaies carried the blowes. As by land, at the encountering of <hi>Grane,</hi> and that of <hi>Sutphen,</hi> where the honor of the world and ornament of England, ſir <hi>P. Sidney</hi> by his aduenturous valor was ſlaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other bickerings and skirmiſhes of leſſe moment needles to recite. Of ſea matters, I account it bootleſſe to ſpeake, ſo greatly and aboue meaſure glorious is the ſame, &amp; bruited through the world: of the worthie voiages of ſir <hi>F. Drake,</hi> ſir <hi>I. Haukins,</hi> ſir <hi>M. Frobiſher,</hi> C. <hi>Raiman,</hi> and the reſt of the braue and couragious Gentlemen, who for the benefit of their countrie, haue not ſpared to make aduenture
<pb facs="tcp:8993:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their liues and fortunes.</p>
                  <p>But if you deſire one example of all, let that then ſerue of his huge late fleet, with which, Golyas like, hee threatned heauen and earth, &amp; with which he thought to haue circumuented and ſurpriſed at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares her Maieſtie, whileſt falſely, wickedly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiuely, hee entertained her Graces Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Flanders with a treatie of peace. To which her Highneſſe lyke a Chriſtian princeſſe, and for to auoide the effuſſion of Chriſtian bloud, was verie vnclinable. But God, as he hath alwaies done, ſo at this time did hee miraculouſly protect her Maieſty in ſuch ſort, that through the great, careful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding valorous reſolution of that moſt worthie and renowmed Gentleman the Lorde Admirall of England, of whoſe couragious behauiour and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, with which he amazed them, the verie enemy himſelfe, though agaynſt his will, makes worthie mention. They were with a ſmall number of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſo fiercely and vigorouſly encountered, that their reſiſtance not preuailing them, they were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, chaſed, and vtterly diſcomfited, in ſuch ſorte as the whole world knoweth, ſo that <hi>Lucans</hi> verſe, me thinkes, may verie fitly bee applyed vnto them, <hi>Territa quaeſitis oſtendunt terga Britannis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, what better triall can you haue of the valour of their nation than this, being thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, the creame of all theyr forces, and aboute the aſſembling of which he had bene three yeres buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet when they came vpon the coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> dared not to lande a man: whereas wee the nexte
<pb facs="tcp:8993:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>yeere following with a little Nauie, containing not aboue eleuen thouſand men, vnder the conduct of the two moſt renowmed Captaines, ſir <hi>Iohn Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and ſir <hi>Frances Drake,</hi> landed in Spaine, burnt his ſhipping, put his people to the ſword, &amp; his townes to the fire, and coaſted thence along into Portugal, and there landing, marched in his countrie, euen to his gates of <hi>Leisbone,</hi> with drums ſounding, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes diſplayed: from whence wee returned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fought withall by anie of his forces either by ſea or land.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things well conſidered, mee thinkes you haue greater reaſon to hope one daie to ſee Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Enſignes diſplayed in <hi>Madrill,</hi> together wyth the vtter ruine of that proude tyrant of Spaine and his holy father the pope, with all their rabble, than anie waie to feare him or his proceedings. And yet there is one point beſides all the aboue rehearſed, out of which wee may receiue ſingular comfort, as that which of all other moſt deepely vexeth and afflicteth his cogitations, and which, no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be long, wil giue vs a great aduantage againſt him, and that is, the contention which hee ſeeth to ſpring vp in his owne houſe, of which I will briefly diſcourſe vnto you the occaſions, becauſe you ſhall vnderſtand the ſame the beeter.</p>
                  <p>Hee hath by ſeuerall wiues three children li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, two Daughters and one ſonne, the Sonne young of yeeres, ſickly of bodie, pale and weake of complexion, of wit poore and vnfurniſhed, in a manner a very idiot.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8993:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>His eldeſt daughter, whom they cal <hi>La Infante</hi> of Spaine, a woman as by birth great, ſo proud excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, haughtie minded, and aboue meaſure aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, prudent, in her ſpeeches maieſticall, in her countenance and actions couragious: her he hath alwaies noriſhed vnder his owne wing, acquainting her euen from her cradle, with matters of ſtate and gouernment. In which now by reaſon of her long traine and experience therein, ſhee is exceedingly practiſed and ripe. With her what waightie matter ſo euer hee vndertaketh, hee participateth the ſame before, demanding her aduice and counſell, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes whole halfe daies they two in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication together. Vpon her (the youths weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; ſimplicitie of the yong prince conſidered) are the eies of all men throwen, vppon her depend the nobilitie, gentility, and commons, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable troups of ſutors, into whoſe hearts ſhe hath ſo inſinuated her ſelfe, that they doo beare an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loue and reuerence towards her, many mightie men haue bin offered her in marriage, as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Rodolph,</hi> the king of Scotland, and diuers other, but ſhe vntil ſhe ſee what wil become of her father, whome ſhe ſeeth olde, oppreſſed with infinit cares, and not likely long to liue, vppon whoſe death, her actions and manner of life doth aſſuredly ſhew, that ſhee is not of mettall ſufficient to giue place to the young idiother brother, but at leaſt ſhe meanes to part ſtakes with him.</p>
                  <p>In Spaine ſhe knowes there is no lawe Salike, to bridle her ambitious thoughtes, but women maye
<pb facs="tcp:8993:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſucceed as men, for ſo grandmother <hi>Iouina</hi> did <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> her father. Hauing theſe examples before her eies, ſhe feedeth her mind with high and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſyres, of which ſhe hath made ſo cleere and euident demonſtrations, that her father to preuent this miſchiefe that hee feareth, was forced this laſt yeere to aſſemble the whole eſtates of Spaine, &amp; to make them ſweare to be true vnto his ſonne, whom hee preſently cauſed to keepe his court a part, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſundrie of his councell, and commanding the nobilitie to bee attendant on him, acquainting him, as much as in them lyeth, with managing of matters of waight, eſtate, and gouernment. Beſides, it is heere bruited for certaine amongeſt vs, that the preſident of <hi>Artois Richardol,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> had ſent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make his excuſes and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications agaynſt certaine pointes of treaſon, of which he was by the Duke of <hi>Pastrauia</hi> and prince of <hi>Aſcoly</hi> accuſed to the king, is now returned with commiſſion to aſſemble the nobles &amp; ſtates of theſe Countries, and to cauſe them to take the like oath to his ſonne, thereby to preuent as well his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> of their conceiued hopes.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to his ſecond daughter, whom he hath long ſithence beſtowed in marriage vppon the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> with abſolute promiſe &amp; ſolemn vow betweene him and her, to leaue her a kingdom for her dowrie. She is a princeſſe in ambition and high deſire nothing ynequall to her ſiſter, but in wit &amp; courage far her inferior, ſhe &amp; her husband both alreadie take vpon them in their manner, ſtile, and
<pb facs="tcp:8993:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>vſage, a ſtate and title far beyond their dignity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient onely vnto kings. <hi>Alteſſa</hi> is the meaneſt phraſe they will be ſpoken in vnto, refuſing any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are not ſo intituled, for ſuch is the will and pleaſure of the king her father. Naples &amp; the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Millaine they haue alreadie deuoured in theyr hopes, which if her father at his death leaue not quietly vnto them, they will be ſo bold as ſtrain curteſie with his ſon, to get them perforce if he can. On the other ſide, the ſtates of Italy like not ſuch a mightie neighbor amongſt them, and therefore to preuent both him and his father in lawes deſſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue made a moſt ſtraight ſecret league &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance among themſelues, tearming the ſame <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne de Stato:</hi> in which are compriſed the pope, the Venetians, the Duke of Florence, the Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, the Dukes of Vrbine, Mantua, and Ferrara: the duke of Parma dared not to enter in among them, but is forced, though none more agreed, to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and temporize than he for a while, he knoweth that the king hath bene exceeding ielous, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, though ſlily and diſſemblingly, his life, honour, and reputation. But aboue al, the diſſention of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, to which hee perſwadeth himſelfe to haue right, as in truth his title is better than that of the king of Spaines, ſticketh deepe in his ſtomacke, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net alta monte repoſtum,</hi> and wee doubt not but one daie, when occaſion ſhall ſerue, hee will make the worlde witneſſe of his diſcontentment, which the king well knoweth and greatly feareth, but he muſt haue patience, for he can hardly remedie it, vnleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:8993:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>the duke will wittingly ouerthrow himſelfe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hauing theſe meanes in his handes which hee hath, not onely to worke his owne ſecuritie, but to crie quittance alſo when time ſhall ſerue.</p>
                  <p>But hauing now exceeded the limits of a Letter, it is time I refraine my pen, hoping that theſe alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged demonſtrations ſhall, if not to worke the good effect which I deſire in you &amp; other Gentlemen of my Countrie, yet at the leaſt to manifeſt the dutiful zeale and loue I beare to the ſtate of my Countrie, as to all faithfull members thereof, in participating vnto them ſuch things as by painful and dangerous experience I haue gathered, and do thinke neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be knowen, wherein I haue vſed ſuch truth, that I hope no man liuing ſhall be able to diſproue mee, though I doubt not but the ſame ſhall bee by ſome malitiouſly cenſured, and my ſelfe ſubiect to abide the brunt of their mallice, beeing aſſured that I ſhall not auoid the poiſoned rancor of their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous defaming tongues and pens. For ſeeing they ſpare not in their traiterous ſpeeches and infamous pamphlets, princes, noblemen, &amp; counſellors, men of great authoritie &amp; vertue, it were folly for me to looke to ſcape ſcot-free. But ſuch is the ioye I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in my good meaning, that I ſhal receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof, as a thing greatly redounding to my credit, of ſuch men as they are to be ill ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Now laſtly for concluſion, whereas you write that if there were no other benefite to be gotten in theſe partes, but attaining the languages of foreine nations, with the knowledge of militarie diſcipline

In which reſpect, I praie you firſt conſider, that when I came firſt ouer hether, the wars then here vndertaken ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; were in apparance to all the manner ſort of men in the worlde. But inteſtine warres betweene the prince and his ſubiects, ſuch as no other foraine prince, and moſt eſpecially our moſt noble Queene &amp; Soueraigne, was then nothing intereſſed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſince it hath bin made manifeſt to the world, that theſe wars and iniuries offered by the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> to thoſe of the Low countries, whoſe laws, cuſtoms and priuiledges, he hath moſt violently, tyranouſly, wrongfully, and periuredly broken, whereby hee hath freed them from his ſubiection, yoake, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranie,
<pb facs="tcp:8993:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>and iuſtly and deſeruedly for euer loſt al ſuch preheminences, prerogatiues, authoritie, and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as he pretended ouer them, as more amply appeareth in the ancient records of the priuiledges of theſe nations, which both he &amp; his predeceſſors at their entrie of gouernment into theſe prouinces haue ſolemnly vowed and ſworne to maintaine all in generall, and euerie in particular inuiolate, &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that couenant and condition they haue reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally ſworn to him due fidelitie and obeiſance, he fayling in the one, they to be exempted from the other. Noreouer, her Maieſtie ſeeing the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt pittifull cauſe of her diſtreſſed neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and allies, finding no other poſsible meanes by laborers, ſutes, meſſages, &amp; ſundrie Embaſſadors which ſhe moſt honorably ſent to the king of <hi>Spain</hi> for pacifieng the ſayd troubles, and reconciling the ſayd king and thoſe: ſometimes his ſayd ſubiectes haue bene inforced to take pittie and commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their moſt miſerable and afflicted eſtate and diſtreſſe, and for their reliefe, to her exceſſiue &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importable charges, to vndertake a moſt iuſt, godly, and charitable defenſiue warre againſt thoſe that daily ſeeke the bloud, liues, goods, lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the inhabitants of the ſayd diſtreſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Since which being publiſhed, I thinke it not onely vnlawful, but alſo a moſt hainous and capital crime and offence for any her Maieſties ſubiectes to ſerue on the contrarie part.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it ſhal be good for you &amp; all other good ſubiects of her Maieſties, to remember that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration being had by her Maieſtie and her moſt

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you or anie other her Graces ſubiectes, ſhall nowe attempt to paſſe the ſeas without lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, there is no reaſon why you ſhuld expect anie other than the rigor of the laws and iuſtice, &amp; to be holden guiltie of caſes capitall, eſpecially ſuch as ſhall ſerue vnder ſo open and profeſſed an enemie to the crowne and ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Further, I praie you to haue in conſideration, that when I came ouer hether, the caſe ſo ſtoode, as all Gentlemen of anie quality or merit, were grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiued, and imploied in good &amp; honorable ſeruices: whereas ſince the Spaniard hath profeſſed himſelfe open enemie to her Maieſtie and the ſtate of her Realme, he hath had all Engliſh-men in verie baſe account, beeing ielous &amp; extremely ſuſpitious of thoſe that bee moſt inward with him, &amp; who for his ſake haue made ſhipwracke not only of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and credit, but alſo of their loialtie, duetie, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to her Maieſtie and their natiue country. Examples whereof are infinite, &amp; partly touched in my Diſcourſe before ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ther is of late crept into that nation a vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood of Ieſuits &amp; prieſts, moſt dangerous &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8993:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>malitious enemies to her Maieſtie, and to their owne countrie vile and pernitious, inſtruments of the pope and his adherents, who daily (as it is manifeſt to them that haue knowledge and experience of them &amp; their actions) ſeeke nothing more than the vtter ruine, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, and deſtruction of her Maieſtie and theyr countrie, which bred and nouriſhed them, &amp; al true profeſſors of the Goſpell and chriſtian religion tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout chriſtendome, he therefore that thinketh to liue amongſt theſe pernitious people in anie credit or account, let him, as he worthily doth deſerue, bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted beſides his wits, or els diſobedient and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to God, her Maieſtie, &amp; his countrie.</p>
                  <p>As for my part, ſeeing the impietie of this place and the wicked and deteſtable end whereto their drifts &amp; practiſes are directed, I haue long ſince retired my ſelf, liuing aloofe from them, abandoning and vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting the merit of my long ſeruice, &amp; all ſuch hopes and prefermentes, which I might as well as anie man elſe of my qualitie of my nation haue pretended and ſhould haue as ſoone obtained.
